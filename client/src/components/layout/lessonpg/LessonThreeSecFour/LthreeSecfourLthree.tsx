          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. Take a look at your keyboard. Notice how
          it's divided into rows and columns, with each key representing a
          specific character, symbol, or function. The standard keyboard layout,
          known as QWERTY, derives its name from the first six letters on the
          top row.

          Finding Your Way: The Home Row
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's position our fingers correctly on the keyboard. Imagine
          your hands resting comfortably on the keys. Your left hand should
          hover over the keys A, S, D, and F, while your right hand should be
          positioned over the keys J, K, L, and the semicolon (;). These keys
          are known as the "home row." By starting from this position, you'll be
          able to navigate the keyboard with ease.
