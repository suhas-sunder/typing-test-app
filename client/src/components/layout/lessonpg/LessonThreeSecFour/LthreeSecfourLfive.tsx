        Mastering the Keyboard: A Journey into Typing
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to the world of typing! Whether you're a student, a
        professional, or just someone navigating the digital landscape,
        proficiency in typing is an invaluable skill. Today, I'll guide you
        through the basics, from understanding the layout of the keyboard to
        mastering the art of typing.

          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard layout most commonly used
          today is the QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters on the
          top row of keys. This layout was designed to prevent jamming on early
          typewriters by spacing out commonly used letters. Take a moment to
          familiarize yourself with the layout:
        </p>
        <pre className="mb-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {`Q W E R T Y U I O P
 A S D F G H J K L
  Z X C V B N M`}
        </pre>
        <p>
          Each row represents a different level of keys, with the home row
          (ASDFGHJKL) being the placement for your fingers when not typing.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Learning the Home Row:</h3>
        <p>
          The home row is where your fingers should naturally rest when not
          typing. Your left hand should hover over ASDF, while your right hand
          should be positioned over JKL; This is the foundation of touch typing,
          allowing you to swiftly move to other keys without looking at the
          keyboard.

          Introducing Typing Techniques:
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a beginner, it's essential to adopt proper typing techniques from
          the start. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            Finger Placement: Each finger should be responsible for certain
            keys. For instance, your left pinky is responsible for the 'A' key,
            while your right index finger is responsible for the 'J' key.
          </li>
          <li>
            Touch Typing: Aim to type without looking at the keyboard. Trust
            your muscle memory and the tactile feedback of the keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Posture: Sit up straight with your feet flat on the floor. Position
            your keyboard so that your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Relaxation: Keep your hands and fingers relaxed. Avoid unnecessary
            tension, which can lead to fatigue and errors.
          </li>
        </ul>
