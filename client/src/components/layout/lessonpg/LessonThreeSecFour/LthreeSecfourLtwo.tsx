          The Basics: Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout, known as QWERTY, gets
          its name from the first six letters on the top row. Take a moment to
          look at your keyboard. Notice how the keys are arranged in rows and
          columns. Each key represents a specific character, symbol, or
          function.

          Getting Started: The Home Row
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, let's position our fingers correctly on the keyboard. Place your
          left hand's fingers on the keys A, S, D, and F, and your right hand's
          fingers on the keys J, K, L, and the semicolon (;). These keys are
          called the "home row." By resting your fingers on the home row, you'll
          be able to reach other keys quickly and efficiently.

          Let's begin with the alphabet. Start by pressing each key gently,
          observing how it corresponds to a specific letter on the screen.
          Visualize the layout of the keyboard, and as you type, try to memorize
          the position of each letter. Remember, repetition is key to mastery.

          Numbers and Symbols: Exploring Beyond the Alphabet
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The keyboard isn't just for typing letters. It also allows us to input
          numbers and symbols. Let's familiarize ourselves with some commonly
          used symbols:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>! - Exclamation Mark</li>
          <li>@ - At Symbol</li>
          <li>- Hash or Pound Symbol</li>
          <li>$ - Dollar Sign</li>
          <li>% - Percent Sign</li>
          <li>^ - Caret Symbol</li>
          <li>& - Ampersand</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To type numbers, simply locate them on the top row of the keyboard.
          However, when typing numbers in quotes, use the shift key to access
          the quotation marks:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>Shift + ' - "</li>
          <li>Shift + 2 - @</li>
          <li>Shift + 3 - #</li>
          <li>Shift + 4 - $</li>
          <li>Shift + 5 - %</li>
        </ul>
