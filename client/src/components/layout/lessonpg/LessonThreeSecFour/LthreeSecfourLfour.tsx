          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin with the basics. Take a moment to gaze upon your keyboard.
          Notice how it's divided into rows and columns, each key representing a
          unique character, symbol, or function. This layout, known as QWERTY,

        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
