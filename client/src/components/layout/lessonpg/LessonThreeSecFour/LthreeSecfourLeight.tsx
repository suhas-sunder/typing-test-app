        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Understanding the Keyboard:</h3>
        <p>
          Before we delve into the world of conditionals and equality, let's
          first familiarize ourselves with the keyboard. Take a moment to
          observe the layout of your keyboard. Notice how it's divided into
          different sections: letters, numbers, symbols, and special keys. Each
          key serves a unique purpose, facilitating efficient typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we progress, you'll discover how to navigate the keyboard with
          ease, enabling you to express your thoughts and ideas with clarity and
          precision.

          Exploring Conditionals and Equality:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's dive into the fascinating world of conditionals and
          equality. In programming, conditionals are statements that execute
          certain actions based on whether a specified condition is true or
          false. Equality operators, such as "==", "!=", "&&", "||", and "!",
          are used to compare values and determine their relationship.
        </p>

        <p>For example, consider the statement:</p>
        <code>apples !== oranges</code>
        <p>
          In this statement, the "!=="" operator checks if the value of "apples"
          is not equal to the value of "oranges." If the values are indeed
          different, the statement evaluates to true.
        </p>

        <p>Another example:</p>
        <code>"1" == 1</code>
        <p>
          In this case, the "==" operator checks if the string "1" is equal to
          the number 1. Despite the difference in data types, the statement
          evaluates to true, showcasing the concept of type coercion in
          JavaScript.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Importance of Practice:</h3>
        <p>
          In conclusion, remember that mastery of typing, along with
          understanding programming concepts like conditionals and equality,
          requires consistent practice. Set aside time each day to practice
          typing exercises and engage in programming tutorials to reinforce your
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          By cultivating a habit of practice, you'll not only improve your
          typing accuracy and speed but also enhance your understanding of
          programming principles and language literacy.
