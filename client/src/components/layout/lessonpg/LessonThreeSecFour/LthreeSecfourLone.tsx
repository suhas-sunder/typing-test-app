        and the art of typing. Whether you're a complete novice or someone with

          Understanding the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. Take a moment to familiarize yourself
          with the layout of the keyboard in front of you. Notice the
          arrangement of letters, numbers, and symbols. Each key serves a
          specific function, and mastering their placement is crucial for
          efficient typing.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">Letters:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The keyboard is divided into several rows, with each row containing a
          set of letters from the alphabet. As you navigate your fingers across
          the keyboard, pay attention to the arrangement of these letters.
          Practice typing them in sequence, starting from the home row (ASDF for
          the left hand and JKL; for the right hand) and gradually moving
          outward.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">Numbers:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          In addition to letters, the keyboard also features a dedicated row of
          numbers at the top. These numbers are essential for tasks such as data
          entry, calculations, and navigating through menus. Practice typing
          each number individually, paying attention to their placement relative
          to the letters.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">Symbols:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Alongside letters and numbers, the keyboard also contains a variety of
          symbols that serve different purposes. From punctuation marks to
          special characters, these symbols play a crucial role in conveying
          meaning and clarity in written communication. Take the time to
          familiarize yourself with the most commonly used symbols and their
          corresponding keys.
        </p>

          Words In Quotes:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          One unique aspect of typing is the use of quotation marks to denote
          dialogue or indicate a direct quotation. These marks, often found on
          the same key as the apostrophe, serve as a visual cue to the reader,
          signaling the beginning and end of quoted text. Practice typing words
          within quotes to become proficient in their usage.
