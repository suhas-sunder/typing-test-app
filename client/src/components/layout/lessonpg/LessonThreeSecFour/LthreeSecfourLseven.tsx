        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin with the basics. Take a moment to examine your keyboard.
          Notice how it's divided into distinct sections: letters, numbers,
          symbols, and special keys. Each key serves a unique purpose, and
          understanding their layout is essential for efficient typing.

          named after the first six letters on the top row. This layout was
          designed to optimize typing speed and minimize errors. As you become
          familiar with the keyboard, you'll discover how to navigate it
