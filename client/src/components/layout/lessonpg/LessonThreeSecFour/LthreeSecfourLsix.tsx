        Unlocking the World of Typing: Your Guide to Mastering Email
        Communication

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Understanding the Keyboard:</h3>
        <p>
          Let's start with the foundation - the keyboard. Take a moment to
          observe your keyboard. Notice how it's divided into different
          sections: letters, numbers, symbols, and special keys. Each key serves
          a unique purpose, and understanding their layout is crucial for
          efficient typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The keys on the keyboard are arranged in a specific pattern called the
          QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters in the top row. This
          layout was designed to minimize typing errors and maximize typing
          speed. As you progress, you'll become familiar with the location of
          each key and develop muscle memory to type effortlessly.

          Introducing Email Communication:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's talk about emails. Email has become one of the primary
          modes of communication in both personal and professional settings.
          Whether you're reaching out to a potential employer, connecting with
          colleagues, or staying in touch with friends and family, knowing how
          to compose a well-crafted email is essential.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Practicing Email Addresses:</h3>
        <p>
          Before we delve into typing emails, let's practice typing email
          addresses. An email address consists of two main parts: the username
          and the domain name, separated by the "@" symbol. For example, in the
          email address "example@email.com," "example" is the username, and
          "email.com" is the domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by typing out various email addresses, focusing on accuracy and
          speed. Pay attention to the placement of the "@" symbol and any
          periods or special characters in the domain name. Practicing email
          addresses will help familiarize you with typing alphanumeric
          characters and special symbols, preparing you for composing full
          emails.

          Enhancing Language Literacy:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's touch on the importance of English language literacy in
          typing. Effective communication relies on a strong command of
          language, including grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation. As you
