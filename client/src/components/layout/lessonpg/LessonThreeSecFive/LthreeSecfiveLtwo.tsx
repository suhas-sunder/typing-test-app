        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the wonderful world of typing! Whether you're a seasoned
          professional or someone who has never touched a keyboard before,
          learning to type is an essential skill in today's digital age. In this

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">The Basics: Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
          First things first, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard. The
          standard keyboard layout is known as the QWERTY layout, named after
          the first six letters in the top row. Take a moment to locate these
          keys on your keyboard: Q-W-E-R-T-Y.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's discuss proper finger placement. Your left hand should
          rest on the keys A-S-D-F, while your right hand should rest on the
          keys J-K-L-; (semicolon). Your thumbs should hover over the spacebar.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">The Art of Typing</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we're comfortable with the keyboard layout and finger
          placement, let's dive into the mechanics of typing. Each finger is
          responsible for certain keys, allowing for efficient and accurate
          typing.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>Left pinky finger: A</li>
          <li>Left ring finger: S</li>
          <li>Left middle finger: D</li>
          <li>Left index finger: F</li>
          <li>Right index finger: J</li>
          <li>Right middle finger: K</li>
          <li>Right ring finger: L</li>
          <li>Right pinky finger: ;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The spacebar should be pressed using either thumb, whichever is more
          comfortable for you.

          Trick Words: A Challenge Worth Conquering
        </h3>
        <p>
          As we progress in our typing journey, we'll encounter words that
          present a challenge due to their unusual spelling or arrangement of
          letters. One such example is "MiXed CasE". Notice how the letters are
          both uppercase and lowercase, requiring precision and attention to
          detail when typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle trick words effectively, practice is key. Start slowly,
          focusing on accuracy rather than speed. As you become more comfortable
          with the tricky words, gradually increase your typing speed. Remember,
          consistency and patience are vital on the path to mastery.
