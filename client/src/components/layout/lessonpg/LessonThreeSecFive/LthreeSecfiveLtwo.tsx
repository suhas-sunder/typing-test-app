          The Basics: Getting Started
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          First things first, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard. The
          standard keyboard layout is known as the QWERTY layout, named after
          the first six letters in the top row. Take a moment to locate these
          keys on your keyboard: Q-W-E-R-T-Y.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Next, let's discuss proper finger placement. Your left hand should
          rest on the keys A-S-D-F, while your right hand should rest on the
          keys J-K-L-; (semicolon). Your thumbs should hover over the spacebar.

          The Art of Typing
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now that we're comfortable with the keyboard layout and finger
          placement, let's dive into the mechanics of typing. Each finger is
          responsible for certain keys, allowing for efficient and accurate
          typing.

          <li>Left index finger: F</li>
          <li>Right index finger: J</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The spacebar should be pressed using either thumb, whichever is more
          comfortable for you.

          Trick Words: A Challenge Worth Conquering
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          As we progress in our typing journey, we'll encounter words that
          present a challenge due to their unusual spelling or arrangement of
          letters. One such example is "MiXed CasE". Notice how the letters are
          both uppercase and lowercase, requiring precision and attention to
          detail when typing.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          To tackle trick words effectively, practice is key. Start slowly,
          focusing on accuracy rather than speed. As you become more comfortable
          with the tricky words, gradually increase your typing speed. Remember,
          consistency and patience are vital on the path to mastery.
