          Getting to Know the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is your gateway to the
          digital world, comprising various keys that serve different functions.
          The standard keyboard layout, known as QWERTY, is named after the
          first six letters in the top row of keys.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of the keyboard sections:</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            Alphanumeric Keys: These keys include letters from A to Z and
            numbers from 0 to 9. They form the foundation of typing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Function Keys: Located at the top row, these keys (F1-F12) perform
            specific functions depending on the software being used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modifier Keys: These keys, such as Shift, Control (Ctrl), and Alt,
            modify the functions of other keys when pressed in combination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation Keys: These keys, including arrows and Home/End, assist
            in navigating documents and interfaces.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Mastering Finger Placement and Typing Techniques
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's talk about finger placement. Imagine your fingers as nimble
          dancers gliding across the keys. Your left hand should rest gently on
          the keys ASDF, while your right hand finds its place on JKL;. Your
          thumbs hover gracefully over the Spacebar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practice the "Mixed Case" technique, where you alternate between
          lowercase and uppercase letters. This helps build muscle memory and
          enhances your typing speed and accuracy.
