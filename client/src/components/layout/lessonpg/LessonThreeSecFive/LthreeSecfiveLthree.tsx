        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Understanding the Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
          Firstly, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard layout. The
          standard keyboard, known as the QWERTY keyboard, is divided into
          several sections:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            Alphanumeric Keys: These are the letters A to Z and the numbers 0 to
            9. They are used to input text and numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Function Keys: Located at the top row, these keys (F1-F12) perform
            specific functions depending on the software being used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modifier Keys: These include Shift, Control (Ctrl), Alt, and the
            Windows or Command key. They modify the functions of other keys when
            pressed in combination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation Keys: These include the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left,
            Right) and the Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys, which are
            used for navigation within documents.
          </li>
          <li>Typing Area: This is where you'll place your fingers to type.</li>
        </ul>

          Finger Placement and Typing Techniques
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's talk about finger placement. The fingers of your left hand
          should rest on the A, S, D, and F keys, while the fingers of your
          right hand should rest on the J, K, L, and ; keys. Your thumbs should
          rest on the Spacebar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practice the "home row" technique, where your fingers rest on the row
          of keys in the middle of the keyboard (ASDF for the left hand and JKL;
          for the right hand). From this position, you'll reach out to type
          other keys.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Learning to Type</h3>
        <p>
          Start with simple exercises to get used to the keyboard layout and
          finger placement. Type out the alphabet slowly, ensuring each key is
          struck with the correct finger. Gradually increase your speed as you
          become more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's address the challenging part â€“ typing tricky words and
          symbols. These include words with unusual spellings, special
          characters, and punctuation marks. Practice typing out these words
          repeatedly until you can do so effortlessly.
