        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Understanding the Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
          First things first, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard. The
          keyboard is divided into several sections, including the alphanumeric
          keys, the function keys, the numeric keypad (usually on the right
          side), and various other control keys.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Alphanumeric Keys:</strong> These are the main keys on the
            keyboard and include letters, numbers, and special characters. They
            are divided into four rows: the top row containing numbers, followed
            by three rows of letters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Function Keys:</strong> These keys, labeled as F1 through
            F12, perform specific functions depending on the software you're
            using.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Numeric Keypad:</strong> Located on the right side of most
            keyboards, this set of keys resembles a calculator and is used
            primarily for entering numbers quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Control Keys:</strong> These keys, such as Shift, Ctrl
            (Control), Alt (Alternate), and the Spacebar, are used in
            combination with other keys to perform various functions.
          </li>

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Basic Typing Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we understand the layout of the keyboard, let's dive into
          some basic typing techniques:
        </p>
        <ol className="mb-4 list-inside list-decimal">
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Posture:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat
            on the floor. Keep your wrists slightly elevated above the keyboard
            and your fingers relaxed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row Position:</strong> The home row is the foundation
            of touch typing. Place your fingers on the middle row of keys (ASDF
            for the left hand and JKL; for the right hand), with your thumbs
            resting on the Spacebar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Assign each finger to specific
            keys. For example, your left pinky should rest on the A key, while
            your right pinky should rest on the semicolon (;) key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Touch Typing:</strong> Practice typing without looking at
            the keyboard. Use your fingertips to strike each key with precision,
            returning to the home row after each keystroke.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Mastering Tricky Words</h3>
        <p>
          Ah, now we come to the crux of the matter: mastering those pesky,
          hard-to-type words. These words often contain combinations of letters
          that can trip up even the most seasoned typists. Here are a few
          strategies to tackle them:
        </p>
        <ol className="mb-4 list-inside list-decimal">
          <li>
            <strong>Break it Down:</strong> When faced with a challenging word,
            break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Focus on typing
            each part accurately before moving on to the next.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Repetition is key to
            mastering tricky words. Incorporate them into your typing drills and
            practice sessions regularly to improve your accuracy and speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Mnemonics:</strong> Create mnemonic devices or mental
            associations to help remember the spelling of difficult words. For
            example, the word "necessary" can be remembered as "one collar, two
            sleeves" (n-e-c-e-s-s-a-r-y).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay Calm and Patient:</strong> Remember, Rome wasn't built
            in a day, and neither is typing mastery achieved overnight. Stay
            patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.
          </li>
        </ol>
