          Focusing on "n", "m", and ",":
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our focus today rests on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand keys "n" and "m", as well as the comma ",". These seemingly
          mundane characters hold significant importance in the English
          language, appearing frequently in words and sentences, much like loyal
          companions guiding you on your typing journey.

          Now, let's familiarize ourselves with the layout of the keyboard.
          Position your right hand comfortably on the home row, where your
          fingers naturally rest. The index finger of your right hand should
          hover above the "n" key, while the middle finger should be poised
          above the "m" key, and the ring finger above the "," key, ready to
          spring into action at your command.

          materialize on the screen, like magic at your fingertips.
