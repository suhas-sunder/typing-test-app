        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Our focus today rests on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand keys "n" and "m", as well as the comma ",". These seemingly
          mundane characters hold significant importance in the English

          Positioning and Typing:

        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's familiarize ourselves with the layout of the keyboard.
          Position your right hand comfortably on the home row, where your
          fingers naturally rest. The index finger of your right hand should
          hover above the "n" key, while the middle finger should be poised
          above the "m" key, and the ring finger above the "," key, ready to
          spring into action at your command.
