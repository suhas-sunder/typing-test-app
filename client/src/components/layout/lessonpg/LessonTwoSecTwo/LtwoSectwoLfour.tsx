          The Basics:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start at the very beginning. The keyboard, with its array of
          keys, may seem daunting at first glance, but fear not! Think of it as
          a musical instrument waiting to be played, with each key producing a
          unique sound – or in our case, a letter.

          Focusing on "n":
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Our focus today rests on the bottom row of keys, particularly the
          right-hand key "n". This unassuming character is like a hidden gem,
          waiting to be discovered. The letter "n" holds a special place in the
          English language, appearing frequently in words and sentences, much
          like a loyal companion accompanying you on your typing journey.

          Positioning and Typing:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's acquaint ourselves with the keyboard layout. Position your
          right hand comfortably on the home row, where your fingers naturally
          rest. The index finger of your right hand should hover above the "n"
          key, ready to spring into action at your command.

          With a gentle press of your index finger, engage the "n" key. Marvel
          at how effortlessly the letter materializes on the screen, as if by
          magic. Congratulations! You've just unlocked the power of typing.

        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          But typing is more than just pressing keys; it's about developing
          muscle memory and finesse. Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers,
          gracefully gliding across the keyboard with each successive keystroke.
          As you practice, strive for fluidity and accuracy, aiming to minimize
