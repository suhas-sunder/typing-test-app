            <strong>Placement:</strong> Rest your right hand gently on the
            keyboard, with your index finger hovering over the 'n' key and your
            middle finger poised over the 'm' key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relaxation:</strong> Keep your hand and fingers relaxed, as
            tension can hinder your speed and accuracy. Think of your fingers as
            graceful dancers, gliding effortlessly across the keys.

            beneath your fingertip as the letter appears on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Middle Finger ('m'):</strong> Transition smoothly to the
            'm' key with your right middle finger. Embrace the rhythm of your
            typing, finding a flow that feels natural and efficient.

          Practice Makes Perfect:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Like any skill worth mastering, typing requires dedication and
          practice. Set aside time each day to hone your abilities, gradually
          increasing both speed and accuracy. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a
