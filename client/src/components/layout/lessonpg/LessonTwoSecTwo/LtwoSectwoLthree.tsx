          Focusing on "n":
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Our focus today lies on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand key "n". This unassuming character may seem insignificant,
          but it holds the potential to unlock a world of possibilities. The
          letter "n" is like a humble building block, forming the foundation of
          countless words and sentences.
