          Our focus today lies on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand key "n". This unassuming character may seem insignificant,
          but it holds the potential to unlock a world of possibilities. The
          letter "n" is like a humble building block, forming the foundation of
          countless words and sentences.

          right hand comfortably on the home row, where your fingers naturally
          rest. The index finger of your right hand should hover over the "n"
