          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing techniques, let's understand the keyboard
          itself. The keyboard is like a canvas for your fingers, with each key
          representing a letter, number, symbol, or function. The bottom row,
          also known as the home row, is where your fingers naturally rest when
          not typing.

          <li>
            <strong>N:</strong> The N key is located to the left of the M key.
            It's commonly used in words like "and," "not," and "new." Try
            pressing it with your right-hand index finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>M:</strong> The M key is to the right of the N key. It's
            frequently used in words like "time," "make," and "home." Use your
            right-hand middle finger to reach this key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&lt;:</strong> The &lt; key is located to the left of the M
            key. It's used in programming languages and various shortcuts. Try
            reaching it with your right-hand ring finger.
          </li>
          <li>

            <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Just like any skill,
            typing requires practice. Spend a few minutes each day focusing on
            the bottom row keys until you feel comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Posture:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat
            on the floor and wrists floating above the keyboard. This posture
            reduces strain and enhances typing speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Typing can be mentally and physically
            taxing, especially for beginners. Take regular breaks to rest your
            hands and prevent fatigue.
