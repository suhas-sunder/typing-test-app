        <p>
          Before we dive into typing techniques, let's understand the keyboard
          itself. The keyboard is like a canvas for your fingers, with each key
          representing a letter, number, symbol, or function. The bottom row,
          also known as the home row, is where your fingers naturally rest when
          not typing.

          Now, let's focus on the right hand's position on the bottom row.
          Here's a breakdown of each key:

        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>N:</strong> The N key is located to the left of the M key.
            It's commonly used in words like "and," "not," and "new." Try
            pressing it with your right-hand index finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>M:</strong> The M key is to the right of the N key. It's
            frequently used in words like "time," "make," and "home." Use your
            right-hand middle finger to reach this key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&lt;:</strong> The &lt; key is located to the left of the M
            key. It's used in programming languages and various shortcuts. Try
            reaching it with your right-hand ring finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&gt;:</strong> The &gt; key is to the right of the M key.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">Learning Tips</h3>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Just like any skill,
            typing requires practice. Spend a few minutes each day focusing on
            the bottom row keys until you feel comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Posture:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat
            on the floor and wrists floating above the keyboard. This posture
            reduces strain and enhances typing speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Typing can be mentally and physically
            taxing, especially for beginners. Take regular breaks to rest your
            hands and prevent fatigue.
