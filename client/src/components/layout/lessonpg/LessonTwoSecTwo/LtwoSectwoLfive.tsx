        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">Focusing on "m" and ",":</h3>
        <p>
          Our focus today centers on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand keys "m" and ",". These seemingly innocuous characters are
          like hidden gems, waiting to be unearthed. The letter "m" and the
          comma "," hold significant importance in the English language,
          appearing frequently in words and sentences, much like reliable
          companions guiding you on your typing journey.

        <p>
          Now, let's acquaint ourselves with the layout of the keyboard.
          Position your right hand comfortably on the home row, where your
          fingers naturally rest. The index finger of your right hand should
          hover above the "m" key, while the middle finger should be poised
          above the "," key, ready to spring into action at your command.

          materialize on the screen, as if by magic. Congratulations! You've

        <p>
          Now, let's address a fundamental aspect of our journey: the English
          language. English can be a rich and intricate tapestry of words and
          expressions, but fret not! With patience and practice, you'll
          gradually unravel its complexities and become adept in its usage.

          helping to structure sentences and convey meaning effectively.
