        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">

          Focusing on "n":
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Today, our focus lies on the bottom row of keys, specifically the
          right-hand key "n". This unassuming character holds immense power, as
          it is frequently used in everyday language. Whether you're composing
          an email, drafting a report, or engaging in casual conversation, the
          letter "n" is indispensable.

        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's delve into the mechanics of typing. Position your right
          hand comfortably on the keyboard, with your index finger poised above
          the "n" key. Feel the texture of the key beneath your fingertip, ready
          to spring into action at your command. With a gentle yet deliberate
          motion, press down on the "n" key. Notice how effortlessly the letter
          appears on the screen, a testament to your newfound skill.
