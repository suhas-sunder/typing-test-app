          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          The keyboard is an essential tool for interacting with a computer.
          Think of it as a canvas for an artist or a piano for a musician. Each
          key represents a different character or function.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-2 text-lg font-medium">Key Areas of the Keyboard:</h4>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row:</strong> This is the middle row of the letter keys
            where your fingers will rest most of the time. The home row includes
            the keys: A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home Position:</strong> This is where your fingers should
            rest when you’re not typing.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Positioning Your Fingers
        </h3>
        <ol className="ml-6 list-decimal">
          <li>
            <strong>Sit Up Straight:</strong> Good posture is crucial for
            effective typing. Sit with your back straight and your feet flat on
            the floor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row Position:</strong> Place your left hand fingers on
            the keys A, S, D, and F.
            <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
              <li>
                Your left pinky should be on <strong>A</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your left ring finger should be on <strong>S</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your left middle finger should be on <strong>D</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your left index finger should be on <strong>F</strong>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Notice the small bumps on the F and J keys. These help you find the
          home row without looking at the keyboard.
