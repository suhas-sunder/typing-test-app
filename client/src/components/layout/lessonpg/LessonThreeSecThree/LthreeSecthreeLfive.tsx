          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. Take a look at your keyboard. Notice how
          the keys are arranged in a specific layout. The standard keyboard
          layout is known as QWERTY, named after the first six letters in the
          top row. Familiarize yourself with the placement of the keys,
          including letters, numbers, and symbols.

          Now that you've been introduced to symbols, it's time to practice!
          Start by typing simple sentences that incorporate these symbols. Take
          it slow at first, focusing on accuracy rather than speed. As you
