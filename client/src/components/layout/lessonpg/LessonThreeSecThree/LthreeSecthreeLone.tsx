          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into the actual typing process, let's familiarize
          ourselves with the keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout is
          called QWERTY, named after the first six letters in the top row of
          keys. This layout is ubiquitous across most English-speaking countries
          and many others worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Take a moment to locate the symbols ~!@#$%^ on your keyboard. These
          symbols are commonly used in various contexts, such as programming,
          mathematics, and digital communication. They hold significance in
          expressing different concepts and commands.

          Learning the Basics
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's begin with the basics of typing. Position your fingers on
          the home row keys: ASDF for the left hand and JKL; for the right hand.
          Your thumbs should rest on the space bar. This position allows for
          optimal reach and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          When typing symbols, use the corresponding keys on the keyboard. For
          instance:

        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            ~ is located on the same key as the ` key, typically found to the
            left of the 1 key.
          </li>
          <li>
            ! is located above the 1 key, often requiring the Shift key to be
            pressed simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            @ is typically located above the 2 key and requires the Shift key as
            well.
          </li>
          <li># is located above the 3 key, again requiring the Shift key.</li>
          <li>$ is located above the 4 key, and so on.</li>
