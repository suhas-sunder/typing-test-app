          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Before we dive into the actual typing process, let's familiarize
          ourselves with the keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout is
          called QWERTY, named after the first six letters in the top row of
          keys. This layout is ubiquitous across most English-speaking countries
          and many others worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Take a moment to locate the symbols ~!@#$%^ on your keyboard. These
          symbols are commonly used in various contexts, such as programming,
          mathematics, and digital communication. They hold significance in
          expressing different concepts and commands.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Learning the Basics</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, let's begin with the basics of typing. Position your fingers on
          the home row keys: ASDF for the left hand and JKL; for the right hand.
          Your thumbs should rest on the space bar. This position allows for
          optimal reach and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When typing symbols, use the corresponding keys on the keyboard. For
          instance:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            ~ is located on the same key as the ` key, typically found to the
            left of the 1 key.
          </li>
          <li>
            ! is located above the 1 key, often requiring the Shift key to be
            pressed simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            @ is typically located above the 2 key and requires the Shift key as
            well.
          </li>
          <li># is located above the 3 key, again requiring the Shift key.</li>
          <li>$ is located above the 4 key, and so on.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As with any skill, practice is key to mastery. Start with simple
          exercises to familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout and
          gradually increase the complexity as you become more proficient. There
          are numerous online resources and typing programs available to help
          you hone your skills.
