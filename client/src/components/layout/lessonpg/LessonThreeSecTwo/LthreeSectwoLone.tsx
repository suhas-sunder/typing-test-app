          The Keyboard: An Overview
        </h3>

          Let's start by getting familiar with the keyboard. A standard keyboard
          consists of various sections, each designed for specific functions.
          Here are the key parts:
        </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Alphanumeric Keys:</strong> These are the main keys you'll
            use for typing letters and numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Function Keys (F1-F12):</strong> These keys perform specific
            functions, often in combination with other keys.
          </li>

            side, is for quick number entry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The home row is the starting point for touch typing. Place your
          fingers on the following keys:
