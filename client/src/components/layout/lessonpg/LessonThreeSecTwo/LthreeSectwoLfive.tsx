          Familiarizing Yourself with the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The keyboard is divided into several sections. The main section
          contains the alphabet, numbers, and various symbols. Surrounding this
          main section are keys such as Shift, Caps Lock, Tab, Enter, Backspace,
          and the arrow keys. Additionally, you'll find a row of function keys
          (F1-F12) at the top of the keyboard, each with its own unique purpose.

          Hand Placement
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Your fingers should rest naturally on the home row keys, which are the
          middle row of keys on the keyboard. For your left hand, your fingers
          should be on the keys A, S, D, and F. For your right hand, your
          fingers should be on the keys J, K, L, and the semicolon (;). Your
          thumbs can rest on the space bar.

          Typing Practice
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          When typing, use the correct fingers for each key. For example, to
          type the letter "A," use your left pinky finger. For the letter "J,"
          use your right index finger. This ensures efficient and accurate
          typing.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Start by typing each letter on the home row, moving your fingers up
          and down as needed. As you become more comfortable, gradually
          incorporate more letters and words into your practice sessions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Typing is not just about pressing keys; it's about developing muscle
          memory and coordination. Practice regularly to improve your speed and
          accuracy. Set aside time each day to dedicate to typing exercises.
          There are many online resources and typing tutorials available to help
          you along the way.

          Using Brackets
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Brackets are punctuation marks used to enclose a specific piece of
          text. There are four main types of brackets: parentheses {"()"},
          square brackets {"[]"}, angle brackets {"<>"}, and curly brackets{" "}
          {"{}"}. Each type has its own distinct function and usage. For
          example, parentheses are often used to enclose additional information
          in a sentence, while square brackets are used to indicate editorial
          changes or clarify a quotation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          In typing, brackets can be accessed by pressing the appropriate key
          combination. For example, to type a curly bracket, press the Shift key
          and the key next to the letter "P" on your keyboard. Similarly, square
          brackets can be typed by pressing the Shift key and the key next to
          the letter "P" on your keyboard.
