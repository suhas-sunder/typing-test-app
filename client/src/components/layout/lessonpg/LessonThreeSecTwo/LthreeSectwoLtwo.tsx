        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">The Basics of Typing</h3>
        <h4 className="text-md mb-1 font-semibold">What is Typing?</h4>
        <p>
          Typing is the process of inputting text by pressing keys on a
          keyboard. A keyboard is an input device that contains keys for each
          letter of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, and other special
          characters. When you press a key, it sends a signal to the computer to
          display the corresponding character on the screen.

          The Layout of the Keyboard
        </h4>
        <p>
          The most common keyboard layout is the QWERTY layout, named after the
          first six letters on the top row of the alphabet keys. Here's a quick
          overview of the different sections of the keyboard:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Alphabet Keys (A-Z):</strong> These keys are used to type
            letters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Number Keys (0-9):</strong> These keys are used to type
            numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Punctuation Keys:</strong> These include keys like the
            period (.), comma (,), question mark (?), etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Keys:</strong> These include keys like Shift, Enter,
            Backspace, and Spacebar.

          Getting Started with Typing
        </h3>
        <h4 className="text-md mb-1 font-semibold">Proper Hand Position</h4>
        <p>
          Before you start typing, it's important to know how to place your
          hands on the keyboard:
        </p>
        <ol className="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row:</strong> The middle row of keys (ASDFJKL;) is
            called the home row. Your fingers should always return to these keys
            when not typing other characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong>
            <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Place your left hand fingers on A, S, D, and F.</li>
              <li>Place your right hand fingers on J, K, L, and ;.</li>
              <li>Your thumbs should rest on the Spacebar.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 className="text-md mb-1 font-semibold">Basic Typing Technique</h4>
        <ol className="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Sit Up Straight:</strong> Good posture helps prevent fatigue
            and injury.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep Wrists Elevated:</strong> Avoid resting your wrists on
            the desk; use a wrist rest if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eyes on the Screen:</strong> Try not to look at your hands
            while typing. This helps build muscle memory.
