          The Fundamentals of Typing
        </h3>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">
          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A keyboard is an input device used to enter characters and functions
          into a computer system. It consists of various keys, each with a
          unique function. The standard QWERTY keyboard layout, which we will
          use, is named after the first six letters on the top row of letters.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">
          Posture and Hand Positioning
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Before you start typing, it’s crucial to understand proper posture and
          hand positioning. Good posture helps prevent fatigue and strain,
          allowing you to type for longer periods comfortably.

          <li>
