          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into typing, let's take a moment to understand our
          keyboard. Think of it as a gateway to the digital world, where each
          key holds the power to express our thoughts and ideas.

            <strong>Home Row:</strong> This is where our fingers naturally rest
            when we're not actively typing. For our right hand, it includes the
            keys J, K, L, and the semicolon (;).

          Now, let's talk about finger placement. Just like a musician positions
          their fingers on a guitar fretboard, we must ensure our fingers are in
          the right position for efficient typing.
