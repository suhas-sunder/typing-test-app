          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
            Precision is paramount in typing, especially in contexts where
            errors can have significant consequences. Writing 100 quotes
            provides ample opportunity for users to focus on accuracy, ensuring

            4. Enhancing Typing Speed:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
            Speed is a hallmark of typing proficiency, and writing 100 quotes
            serves as an effective means to increase typing speed. As users
            familiarize themselves with the quotes, they naturally become faster
            at transcribing them. Typing tests often provide metrics such as
            words per minute (WPM), allowing users to track their progress and
            set goals for improvement. Through consistent practice, users can
            gradually surpass their previous speed benchmarks, achieving greater
            efficiency in their typing endeavors.
