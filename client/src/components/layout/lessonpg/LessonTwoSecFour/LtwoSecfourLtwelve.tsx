          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The standard keyboard layout, known as QWERTY, derives its name from
          the arrangement of the first six letters on the top row. This layout
          was designed to prevent jamming of mechanical typewriters by placing
          commonly used letter pairs apart. Familiarize yourself with the
          layout, noting the placement of letters, numbers, and special
          characters.

          <li>
            Begin by practicing individual letters. Press each key with the
            corresponding finger, focusing on precision and control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually introduce letter combinations and words. Start with simple
            words, then progress to more complex ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay attention to capitalization. Utilize the Shift key with the
            appropriate hand to type uppercase letters. For mixed-case words,
            alternate between hands for a seamless flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice punctuation and special characters. These symbols play a
            vital role in conveying meaning and tone in written communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop rhythm and fluidity. Typing is akin to playing a musical
            instrument; with practice, you'll achieve harmony between your
            fingers and the keyboard.
