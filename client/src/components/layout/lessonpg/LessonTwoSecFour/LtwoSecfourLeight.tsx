          Understanding the Basics
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start from the basics. Typing is the process of inputting text
          into a device, usually a computer or a smartphone, by pressing keys on
          a keyboard. Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a specific letter,
          number, symbol, or function.

          Getting Familiar with the Keyboard Layout
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          For beginners like you who are just starting out, it's important to
          familiarize yourself with the layout of the keyboard. The standard
          keyboard layout used in most English-speaking countries is called
          QWERTY, named after the first six letters on the top row of keys. The
          keys you'll be focusing on initially are located on the right-hand
          side of the keyboard, specifically the characters: yuiophjklbnm.

          Mechanics of Typing
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's dive into the mechanics of typing. Place your fingers on
          the home row, which is the middle row of keys on the keyboard where
          your fingers naturally rest. For your right hand, position your index
          finger on the y key, your middle finger on the u key, your ring finger
          on the i key, and your pinky finger on the o key. Your thumb should
          rest on the space bar.

          Practice Makes Perfect
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Practice is key to improving your typing skills. Start with slow,
          deliberate movements and gradually increase your speed as you become
          more comfortable with the keyboard layout. Set aside time each day to
          practice typing exercises or transcribing passages from books or
          articles.
