          Proper Finger Placement:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's talk about the correct positioning of your fingers on the

          index finger should be on the "j" key, your middle finger on the "k"
          key, and so forth. This position ensures optimal reach and efficiency
          while typing.
