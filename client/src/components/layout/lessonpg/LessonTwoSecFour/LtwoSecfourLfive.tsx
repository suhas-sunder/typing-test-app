          Understanding the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is your canvas, and each key
          is a brushstroke waiting to create words. On a standard QWERTY
          keyboard, your right hand will primarily dance across the keys Y, U,
          I, O, P, H, J, K, L, B, N, and M. These keys will be your allies as
          you embark on this typing adventure.

          Proper Finger Placement:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Just as a musician learns to position their fingers on the keys of a
          piano, a typist must master the art of proper finger placement.
          Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers, gracefully gliding across the
          keyboard. Your right hand fingers, assigned to the keys mentioned
          earlier, should rest naturally on these designated keys.

          The Intersection of Typing and Literacy:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Typing isn't just about pressing keys; it's about unlocking the door
          to literacy. As you become more adept at typing, you'll notice a
          remarkable improvement in your spelling, vocabulary, and overall

          Navigating English Language:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          English, like any language, can be complex, but fear not! Let's break
          it down. In English, words are composed of letters, each carrying its
          own sound and meaning. By mastering typing, you'll not only enhance
          your ability to construct sentences but also deepen your understanding
          of English grammar and syntax.
