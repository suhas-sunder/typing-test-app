          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start from the very basics. The keyboard is your canvas, and
          your fingers are the brushes. Each key represents a letter, number, or
          symbol. We'll focus on the left-hand side of the keyboard for now,
          specifically the keys: Q, W, E, R, T, A, S, D, F, G, Z, X, C, and V.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Position your fingers on the home row, where the fingers naturally
          rest: left pinky on 'A', left ring finger on 'S', left middle finger
          on 'D', and left index finger on 'F'. Your right hand should remain
          relaxed on the desk or keyboard, ready to spring into action when
          needed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          As you begin to type, use the designated fingers for each key. For
          instance, the left pinky reaches for 'Q', the left ring finger for
          'W', and so on. Imagine each finger as a dedicated worker, efficiently
          pressing its assigned key to produce the desired letter.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Practice is key to mastering typing. Start with simple exercises,
          gradually increasing speed and accuracy as you become more comfortable
          with the keyboard layout. Don't be discouraged by mistakes; they're
          stepping stones on the path to proficiency.
