          Getting Started: Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start from the very beginning. Typing involves using a keyboard
          to input text into a computer or other electronic device. The keyboard
          consists of various keys, each representing a different character,
          symbol, or function. The keys are organized into rows, with the most
          commonly used letters positioned in the middle row, known as the home
          row.

          Focusing on the Left Hand Characters
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          For our lesson today, we'll focus on the characters found on the left
          side of the home row. These characters are "q, w, e, r, t, a, s, d, f,
          g, z, x, c, v, b."

          Positioning Your Left Hand
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          To begin typing, position your left hand so that your fingers are
          resting lightly on the home row keys. Your index finger should rest on
          the "f" key, your middle finger on the "d" key, your ring finger on
          the "s" key, and your pinky finger on the "a" key. This is your
          starting position.

            Art: Start by pressing the "a" key with your pinky finger, followed
            by the "r" key with your ring finger, and finally the "t" key with
            your middle finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sad: Use your ring finger for "s", middle finger for "a", and index
            finger for "d".

          The Importance of English Language Skills
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
