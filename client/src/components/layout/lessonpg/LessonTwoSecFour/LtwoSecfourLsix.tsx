        skill or seeking to refine your abilities, I'm here to guide you through
        every step of the way. Typing is not just about hitting keys on a

          Understanding the Basics:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          First things first, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard
          layout. A standard keyboard consists of alphabetic, numeric, and
          special character keys. The alphabetic keys are divided into two main
          sections: the left-hand side, which contains letters A to Z, and the
          right-hand side, mirroring the same layout.

          Getting Comfortable with the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's talk about hand positioning. Place your fingers on the home
          row, which is the middle row of alphabetic keys. Your left index
          finger should rest on the letter "F," and your right index finger on
          the letter "J." From there, let your other fingers naturally fall onto
          adjacent keys. This positioning allows for efficient movement across
          the keyboard.

          Starting with the Basics:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Begin by practicing typing simple words using both hands. Start with
          words that utilize letters from the home row such as "dad," "sad," or
          "fad." Gradually incorporate letters from the rows above and below the
          home row to expand your range of motion. Remember to maintain proper
          posture and avoid looking at the keyboard as much as possible to build
          muscle memory.

          Mastering Uppercase Letters:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          In English, uppercase letters are used for proper nouns, the beginning
          of sentences, and emphasis. To type uppercase letters with both hands,
          simply hold down the "Shift" key with the pinky finger of your
          opposite hand while striking the desired letter key with the
          corresponding finger. Practice typing uppercase letters along with
          lowercase ones to improve fluency.
