          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing techniques, let's familiarize ourselves
          with the keyboard layout. The keyboard is divided into several
          sections, but for now, we'll focus on the main area where your fingers
          will dance to create words: the home row.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The home row consists of the keys where your fingers naturally rest:
          A, S, D, F, J, K, L, and the semicolon (;). We'll focus on the left
          hand for now, specifically the keys Q, W, E, R, T, A, S, D, F, G, Z,
          X, C, and V. These keys form the foundation of your typing prowess.

          The Basics of Typing
        </h3>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Posture:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat on the
            ground. Keep your wrists elevated above the keyboard to avoid
            strain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Position your left hand so that
            your pinky finger rests on the A key, your ring finger on the S key,
            your middle finger on the D key, and your index finger on the F key.
            This forms the base position for your left hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Typing Motion:</strong> Use a fluid motion to press each
            key, avoiding unnecessary strain or tension in your fingers. Press
            each key with a gentle but firm touch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy Over Speed:</strong> Focus on accuracy first,
            gradually increasing your speed as you become more comfortable with
            the keyboard layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Like any skill,
            typing improves with consistent practice. Set aside time each day to
            hone your skills and watch your proficiency soar.
