          Getting Started:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin with the basics. The keyboard, as you may know, is a tool
          used for inputting text into a computer or other devices. It consists
          of a set of keys arranged in a specific layout. The most common
          keyboard layout is the QWERTY layout, named after the first six
          letters on the top row of keys.
