          Getting Started: Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into typing exercises, let's familiarize ourselves with
          the keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout is known as QWERTY,
          named after the first six letters in the top row. Your focus for now
          will be on the right-hand side of the keyboard, particularly the keys:{" "}
          <strong>y, u, i, o, p, h, j, k, l, b, n,</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>m</strong>. These keys will be your starting point as you
          begin your typing journey.

          The Basics of Typing Technique
        </h3>
        <p>
          Typing efficiently requires proper technique. Sit up straight, keep
          your wrists elevated, and position your fingers on the home row keys.
          For your right hand, place your index finger on the <strong>j</strong>{" "}
          key, middle finger on the <strong>k</strong> key, ring finger on the{" "}
          <strong>l</strong> key, and pinky finger on the <strong>;</strong>{" "}
          key. This positioning allows for quick and accurate movements across
          the keyboard.
