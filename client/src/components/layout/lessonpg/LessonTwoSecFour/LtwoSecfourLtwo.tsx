          Getting Started: Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into typing exercises, let's familiarize ourselves with
          the keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout is known as QWERTY,
          named after the first six letters in the top row. Your focus for now
          will be on the right-hand side of the keyboard, particularly the keys:{" "}
          <strong>y, u, i, o, p, h, j, k, l, b, n,</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>m</strong>. These keys will be your starting point as you
          begin your typing journey.
