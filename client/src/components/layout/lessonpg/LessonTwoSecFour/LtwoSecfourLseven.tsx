          The Keyboard: Your Canvas of Creativity
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we embark on our typing adventure, let's acquaint ourselves
          with the keyboard, your trusty companion in the realm of words. Take a
          moment to observe the arrangement of keys before you. Notice how they
          are divided into sections, each serving a specific purpose. Today,
          we'll focus on the left-hand side of the keyboard, where the journey
          begins.

          Understanding the Left Hand Layout:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The left-hand side of the keyboard houses a cluster of keys that will
          soon become your allies in the quest for typing mastery. These keys
          include:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            QWERT - The top row, starting from the left, consists of letters
            "Q," "W," "E," "R," and "T."
          </li>
          <li>
            ASDFG - Directly below, you'll find the row with letters "A," "S,"
            "D," "F," and "G."
          </li>
          <li>
            ZXCVB - Lastly, at the bottom, lie the keys "Z," "X," "C," "V," and
            "B."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          Positioning Your Fingers:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Just as a painter must hold their brush with precision, you must
          position your fingers on the keyboard with care. Rest your left index
          finger on the key "F," your middle finger on "D," your ring finger on
          "S," and your pinky finger on "A." These fingers will serve as the
          brushes with which you craft your literary masterpieces.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          Starting Small:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now that you're acquainted with the layout and positioning, it's time
          to dip your toes into the waters of typing. Begin by practicing simple
          words that utilize only the keys of your left hand. Start with words
          like "sad," "fad," or "bag." As you grow more comfortable, gradually
          incorporate additional keys into your repertoire.
