          Introduction to the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is divided into several
          sections, each serving a specific purpose. The number row, located at
          the top of the keyboard, is our focus for today. It consists of the
          numbers 1 through 0, aligned from left to right.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's get familiar with the layout. Take a moment to observe the
          number row on your keyboard. Notice how the numbers ascend from left
          to right, mirroring the layout of a traditional numeric keypad. This
          arrangement is designed for efficiency and ease of use.

          Getting Started: Basic Typing Techniques
        </h3>
        <ol className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Position your hands comfortably on
            the keyboard, with your fingers resting lightly on the home row
            keys. For the number row, extend your fingers slightly upward to
            reach the numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Assign each finger to a specific
            set of keys. For the number row, your index finger should rest on
            the 1 key, with each subsequent finger aligned to the corresponding
            number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Typing Motion:</strong> Practice pressing each key with a
            gentle, controlled motion. Avoid slamming the keys or using
            excessive force, as this can lead to fatigue and reduced accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy Over Speed:</strong> Focus on accuracy rather than
            speed initially. As you become more proficient, your typing speed
            will naturally increase.
