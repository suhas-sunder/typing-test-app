          Introduction to Typing
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we delve into the intricacies of typing, let's begin with the
          fundamentals. The keyboard is your gateway to the digital realm, and
          mastering its layout is the first step towards efficient typing.

          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout. Notice
          the arrangement of keys, including the letter keys, number keys,
          punctuation marks, and special function keys.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Today, we'll focus on the number row, which consists of the keys
          "1234567890-=" located at the top of the keyboard. These keys allow
          you to input numerical values quickly and accurately.

          Positioning Your Hands
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Proper hand positioning is crucial for typing efficiently. Place your
          left hand on the keys "1" through "=" and your right hand on the
          corresponding keys on the right side of the keyboard. Keep your
          fingers relaxed and curved, hovering above the keys.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          The Home Row
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          While we're discussing hand positioning, it's essential to mention the
          home row. The home row consists of the keys "ASDF" for your left hand
          and "JKL;" for your right hand. These keys serve as the base from
          which you'll reach out to other keys while typing.

          Practicing Typing Exercises
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's put theory into practice. Begin by slowly typing the
          numbers "1234567890-=" repeatedly, focusing on accuracy rather than
          speed. As you become more comfortable, gradually increase your typing
          speed while maintaining precision.
