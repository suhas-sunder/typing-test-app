          Understanding the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard. The number row, located at the top of the keyboard, consists
          of the numerals 1 through 0. However, when you hold down the Shift key
          (typically located on both ends of the keyboard), these numerals
          transform into special characters: !, @, #, $, %, and ^.

          Now, onto the practical aspect. Place your fingers on the home row,
          where your left index finger rests on the "F" key and your right index
          finger rests on the "J" key. From this position, your other fingers
          naturally align with the keys surrounding the home row.
