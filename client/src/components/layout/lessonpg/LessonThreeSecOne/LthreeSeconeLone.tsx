      <section>
        <p>
          Welcome to the world of typing! Today, we're going to embark on a
          journey to master one of the fundamental aspects of typing: the number
          row, represented by the sequence of numbers 1 through 6 located at the

        </h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The standard keyboard layout consists of several rows

          <li>
            <strong>Ring Finger:</strong> Position your right ring finger on the
