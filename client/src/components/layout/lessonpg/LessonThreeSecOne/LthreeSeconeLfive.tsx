          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin with the basics. The keyboard is divided into several
          sections, each serving a specific purpose. One crucial section is the
          "number row," located just above the letter keys. Here, you'll find
          the numbers 1 through 0, as well as some special characters like &, *,
          (, ), _, and +.

          Positioning Your Fingers:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing exercises, it's essential to establish the
          correct finger placement. Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers,
          gracefully gliding across the keys. For the number row, your right
          index finger should rest on the "6" key, and your other fingers should
          naturally align with the remaining keys.

        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's practice! Begin by placing your fingers on the home row—the
          row where the keys ASDFGHJKL; are located. From this position, gently
          extend your fingers to reach the numbers and special characters above.
