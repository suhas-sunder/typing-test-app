          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let's begin with the basics. The keyboard is divided into several
          sections, each serving a specific purpose. One crucial section is the
          "number row," located just above the letter keys. Here, you'll find
          the numbers 1 through 0, as well as some special characters like &, *,
          (, ), _, and +.

          Positioning Your Fingers:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into typing exercises, it's essential to establish the
          correct finger placement. Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers,
          gracefully gliding across the keys. For the number row, your right
          index finger should rest on the "6" key, and your other fingers should
          naturally align with the remaining keys.

        <p>
          Now, let's practice! Begin by placing your fingers on the home row—the
          row where the keys ASDFGHJKL; are located. From this position, gently
          extend your fingers to reach the numbers and special characters above.
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Start Slowly:</strong> Begin by typing each number and
            special character individually. Take your time to ensure accuracy
            and proper finger placement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat:</strong> Practice makes perfect!
            Repeat the exercise, gradually increasing your speed as you become
            more comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on Accuracy:</strong> Speed is essential, but accuracy
            should always be your top priority. Pay close attention to each
            keystroke, aiming for precision in your typing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Online Typing Tools:</strong> There are many online
            resources and typing games designed to help improve your skills.
            Take advantage of these resources to reinforce what you've learned.
