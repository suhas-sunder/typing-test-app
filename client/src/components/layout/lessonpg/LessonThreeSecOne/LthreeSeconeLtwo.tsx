          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before delving into typing, it's essential to understand the layout of
          a standard keyboard. The number row is the row located at the top of
          the keyboard, just above the letters. This row consists of the numbers
          1 through 0, along with symbols such as - and =.

          Basic Finger Placement:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          To efficiently type on the number row, you'll need to place your
          fingers correctly on the keyboard. For the numbers 7, 8, and 9, use
          your left index, middle, and ring fingers respectively. For 0, use
          your right index finger. For the symbols - and =, use your right ring
          and pinky fingers respectively.
