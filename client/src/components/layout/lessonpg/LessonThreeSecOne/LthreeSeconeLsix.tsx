          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. The standard keyboard layout consists of
          several rows of keys, each serving a specific purpose. The number row,
          located at the top of the keyboard, contains the digits 1 through 0,
          along with special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, ^, and &. These
          characters are commonly used in various contexts, from entering
          numerical data to typing passwords and symbols in online
          communication.

          Positioning Your Fingers
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now that you know where the number row is located, it's time to learn
          how to position your fingers correctly. Place your left index finger
          on the "1" key and your right index finger on the "6" key. Your
          remaining fingers should naturally rest on the keys adjacent to these
          starting points. This positioning allows for efficient movement across
          the number row as you type.

          Practicing Proper Technique
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          As with any new skill, practice is key to improvement. Begin by slowly
          typing each digit and special character on the number row, paying
          close attention to accuracy and finger placement. Gradually increase
          your speed as you become more comfortable with the movements. Remember
          to maintain a relaxed posture and avoid tensing your fingers or
          wrists.
