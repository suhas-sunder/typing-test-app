          Introduction to the Number Row
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin by familiarizing ourselves with the number row. Positioned
          at the top of your keyboard, the number row consists of the digits 7,
          8, 9, 0, along with special characters such as -, =, &, *, (, ), _,
          and +. These characters serve various purposes, from entering
          numerical data to creating symbols in documents and emails.

          Finger Placement and Technique
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's talk about finger placement and technique. Imagine your
          fingers as nimble dancers, gracefully gliding across the keys. Start
          by positioning your left index finger on the "7" key and your right
          index finger on the "0" key. Your other fingers should rest gently on
          the keys adjacent to these starting points. As you type, maintain a
          relaxed posture and avoid unnecessary tension in your hands and
          wrists.
