          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The QWERTY keyboard layout is the most commonly used
          layout for English-language keyboards. Its name comes from the first
          six letters in the top row. This layout was designed to prevent
          jamming on typewriters by separating commonly used letter pairs.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's focus on the top row: qwertyuiop. This row represents the
          first line of letters on your keyboard, starting from the left.

          Getting Started
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>Positioning:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat on
          the floor. Place your hands on the keyboard, with your fingers resting
          lightly on the home row keys (ASDF for the left hand, and JKL; for the
          right hand).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Your left index finger should
          naturally rest on the F key, while your right index finger should rest
          on the J key. This positioning helps you orient yourself on the
          keyboard without looking.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>Finger Assignment:</strong> Assign each finger to a specific
          set of keys. For the top row, your fingers should hover over the
          letters as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Left Hand:</strong> Index finger (Q), Middle finger (W),
            Ring finger (E), Pinky finger (R)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Hand:</strong> Index finger (P), Middle finger (O),
            Ring finger (I), Pinky finger (U)
          </li>

          Typing Exercise

          each key gently, one at a time, using the assigned finger. As you
          press each key, focus on maintaining a steady rhythm and avoiding
