        Mastering the Keyboard: Your Gateway to Efficiency
      </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the exciting journey of learning to type! Today, we'll delve
        into the basics, starting with the top row of letters on the keyboard:
        qwertyuiop.

          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The QWERTY keyboard layout is the most commonly used
          layout for English-language keyboards. Its name comes from the first
          six letters in the top row. This layout was designed to prevent
          jamming on typewriters by separating commonly used letter pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's focus on the top row: qwertyuiop. This row represents the
          first line of letters on your keyboard, starting from the left.

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Positioning:</strong> Sit up straight with your feet flat on
          the floor. Place your hands on the keyboard, with your fingers resting
          lightly on the home row keys (ASDF for the left hand, and JKL; for the
          right hand).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Your left index finger should
          naturally rest on the F key, while your right index finger should rest
          on the J key. This positioning helps you orient yourself on the
          keyboard without looking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Finger Assignment:</strong> Assign each finger to a specific
          set of keys. For the top row, your fingers should hover over the
          letters as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Left Hand:</strong> Index finger (Q), Middle finger (W),
            Ring finger (E), Pinky finger (R)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Hand:</strong> Index finger (P), Middle finger (O),
            Ring finger (I), Pinky finger (U)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Let's practice typing the letters on the top row. Start by pressing
          each key gently, one at a time, using the assigned finger. As you
          press each key, focus on maintaining a steady rhythm and avoiding
          unnecessary tension in your hands.
