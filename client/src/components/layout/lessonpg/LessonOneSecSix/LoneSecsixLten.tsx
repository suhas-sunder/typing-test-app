          Introduction to the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before delving into the intricacies of typing, let's familiarize
          ourselves with the keyboard layout. The QWERTY keyboard layout, named
          after the first six letters in the top row, is the most widely used
          keyboard layout in the world. Each key on the keyboard corresponds to
          a specific letter, number, symbol, or function.

        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The top row of the keyboard holds the keys for the letters Q, W, E, R,
          T, Y, U, I, O, and P in both uppercase and lowercase forms. These keys
          are the foundation of many words and sentences, making them crucial

          Understanding Finger Placement:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          To become proficient at typing, it's essential to understand proper
          finger placement on the keyboard. Place your left index finger on the
          "F" key and your right index finger on the "J" key. This position
          serves as your home row, providing a reference point for the rest of
          your fingers.

          The Typing Technique:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's dive into the typing technique. Start by placing your
          fingers on the home row keys. When typing letters from the top row,
          use the fingers closest to each key. For example:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            Q and W are typed using the left index and middle fingers,
            respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            E, R, and T are typed using the left ring, middle, and index
            fingers, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Y, U, I, O, and P are typed using the right index, middle, ring,
            pinky, and pinky fingers, respectively.
