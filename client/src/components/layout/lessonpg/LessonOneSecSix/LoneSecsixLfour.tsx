          Getting Started: Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we delve into the mechanics of typing, let's familiarize
          ourselves with the keyboard layout. The keyboard, a crucial input
          device for computers, consists of several keys arranged in a specific
          layout. The top row, known as the "qtyp" row, contains the letters Q,
          T, Y, and P, among others.
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Q:</strong> The letter Q is the first key in the top row.
            It's a consonant and often appears in words such as "quick,"
            "quest," and "quality."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>T:</strong> Moving along the row, we encounter the letter T.
            T is one of the most frequently used letters in the English
            language, found in words like "the," "to," and "that."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Y:</strong> Next up is the letter Y, another versatile
            consonant commonly found in words like "you," "yet," and "year."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>P:</strong> Finally, we reach the letter P. P is also a
            consonant and features prominently in words such as "people,"
            "place," and "power."
          </li>
        </ul>

          Finger Placement: The Home Row Technique
        </h3>
        <p>
          Imagine the keyboard as a musical instrument, and your fingers as
          skilled musicians ready to create beautiful melodies of words and
          sentences. The home row technique is the foundation of proficient
          typing, ensuring that each finger is assigned to a specific set of
          keys for maximum speed and accuracy.
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Left Hand:</strong> Position your left hand so that your
            pinky finger rests on the A key, your ring finger on the S key, your
            middle finger on the D key, and your index finger on the F key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Hand:</strong> Similarly, place your right hand with
            your pinky finger on the ; (semicolon) key, your ring finger on the
            L key, your middle finger on the K key, and your index finger on the
            J key.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Maintaining this home row position allows you to swiftly reach keys in
          other rows without straining your fingers, akin to playing a melody
          smoothly on a piano.

          Practicing Typing: Start Slow, Aim for Accuracy
        </h3>
        <p>
          Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Begin by typing
          simple exercises or sentences, focusing on accuracy rather than speed.
          As you gain confidence, gradually increase your typing speed while
          maintaining precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is typing
          proficiency achieved overnight. Consistent practice is key to honing
          your typing skills and reaping the rewards in both personal and
          professional endeavors.
