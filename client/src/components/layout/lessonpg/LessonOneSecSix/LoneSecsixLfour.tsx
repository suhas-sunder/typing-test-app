          layout. The top row, known as the "qwerty" row, contains the letters
          Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, and P.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">

          Finger Placement: The Home Row Technique
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Imagine the keyboard as a musical instrument, and your fingers as
          skilled musicians ready to create beautiful melodies of words and
          sentences. The home row technique is the foundation of proficient
          typing, ensuring that each finger is assigned to a specific set of
          keys for maximum speed and accuracy.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Left Hand:</strong> Position your left hand so that your
            pinky finger rests on the A key, your ring finger on the S key, your
            middle finger on the D key, and your index finger on the F key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Hand:</strong> Similarly, place your right hand with
            your pinky finger on the ; (semicolon) key, your ring finger on the
            L key, your middle finger on the K key, and your index finger on the
            J key.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Maintaining this home row position allows you to swiftly reach keys in
          other rows without straining your fingers, akin to playing a melody
          smoothly on a piano.

        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Begin by typing
          simple exercises or sentences, focusing on accuracy rather than speed.
          As you gain confidence, gradually increase your typing speed while
          maintaining precision.

          proficiency achieved overnight. Consistent practice is key to honing
          your typing skills and reaping the rewards in both personal and
          professional endeavors.
