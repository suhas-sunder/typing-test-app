          Getting Started: Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is your canvas, and each key
          is a brushstroke that paints the picture of your thoughts onto the
          digital canvas. At the top row of your keyboard, you'll find the keys:
          Q, W, E, Y, U, I. These keys are your gateway to the realm of typing.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Each key has a unique purpose and position. For instance, the Q key
          sits at the leftmost end of the row, followed by W and E. These keys
          are not randomly placed; they're strategically positioned for optimal
          typing efficiency.

          The Home Row Concept
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we delve into typing individual keys, let's introduce the
          concept of the home row. Picture your fingers resting comfortably on
          the keyboard. The home row is where your fingers naturally fall: A, S,
          D, F, J, K, L, ;. From this position, your fingers can effortlessly
          reach out to the keys above and below, including the top row.

          Typing the Top Row
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's focus on the top row: QWEYUI.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Q:</strong> Your left pinky finger comfortably reaches out
            to press this key. It's often used in combination with other keys
            for shortcuts or commands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>W:</strong> Transition smoothly to the left ring finger to
            press this key. Like Q, it's frequently used in shortcuts and
            commands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E:</strong> Your left middle finger naturally rests on this
            key. It's one of the most commonly used letters in the English
            language, so get comfortable with it!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Y:</strong> As we move to the right side, your right middle
            finger takes charge of pressing Y. This key may not be as frequent
            as E, but it's still crucial.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>U:</strong> Your right ring finger extends to press U. Like
            its neighbors, it plays a significant role in forming words.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I:</strong> Lastly, your right pinky finger taps I. Another
            frequently used letter, mastering this key will significantly boost
            your typing speed.
          </li>
