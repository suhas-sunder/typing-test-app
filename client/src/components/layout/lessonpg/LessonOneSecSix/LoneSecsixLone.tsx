          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is divided into several
          rows, each containing different letters and symbols. The top row,
          which includes the letters "Q," "W," "E," "R," "T," "Y," "U," "I,"
          "O," and "P," is where we'll begin our journey.

          Getting Started
        </h3>
        <ol className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Familiarize Yourself with the Layout:</strong> Take a moment
            to locate the keys on the top row of your keyboard. Notice how each
            key is positioned and spaced from the others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Finger Placement:</strong> For optimal typing speed
            and accuracy, it's essential to use the correct fingers for each
            key. Place your left index finger on the "Q" key, your middle finger
            on the "W" key, your ring finger on the "E" key, and your little
            finger on the "R" key. On the right side, use the same fingers for
            the corresponding keys, starting with your right little finger on
            the "P" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice Typing:</strong> Start with simple exercises to get
            accustomed to the motion of pressing each key. Begin by typing each
            letter individually, focusing on using the correct fingers and
            maintaining a steady rhythm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build Muscle Memory:</strong> Like any skill, typing
            requires practice to improve. Repetition will help your fingers
            memorize the positions of the keys, allowing you to type more
            efficiently over time.
