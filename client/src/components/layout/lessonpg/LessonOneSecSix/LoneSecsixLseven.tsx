          The Basics: Getting Acquainted with the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we delve into the intricacies of typing, let's familiarize
          ourselves with the keyboard layout. The keyboard consists of several
          rows of keys, each serving a specific purpose. The top row, known as
          the "QWERTY" row, is where our journey begins.
        </p>
        <ol className="mt-4 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>QWERTY Row:</strong> This row comprises the letters "Q,"
            "W," "E," "R," "T," "Y," "U," "I," "O," and "P." These keys are
            fundamental to typing, forming the foundation upon which we build
            our proficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Proper finger placement is
            crucial for efficient typing. Each finger is assigned to specific
            keys on the keyboard. For instance, your left index finger rests on
            the "F" key, while your right index finger rests on the "J" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Posture and Ergonomics:</strong> Maintaining good posture
            and ergonomics is essential to prevent fatigue and strain while
            typing. Sit up straight, with your feet flat on the floor, and
            ensure your wrists are in a neutral position to minimize discomfort.
