          Understanding the Keyboard:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The keyboard is like a map, with each key representing a unique
          destination. The top row, also known as the QWERTY row, is where we'll
          begin our exploration. Here, you'll find some of the most frequently
          used letters in the English language.

            <strong>Q:</strong> This letter often gets overlooked, but it's a
            vital part of the English language. Think of it as the quiet hero,
            appearing at the beginning of words like "queen" and "quest."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E:</strong> Ah, the versatile E! It's the most commonly used
            letter in English, making it a cornerstone of your typing journey.
            From "elephant" to "energy," you'll find E everywhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Y:</strong> This letter adds a touch of mystery to words.
            It's like the silent observer, subtly shaping phrases like "mystery"
            and "symbol."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I:</strong> The majestic I stands tall in words,
            representing the self and individuality. From "imagine" to
            "inspire," it's a beacon of personal expression.
          </li>

          Getting Started with Typing:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now that you're acquainted with our top row companions, let's dive
          into the practical aspect of typing. Sit comfortably at your keyboard,
          ensuring your fingers rest gently on the home row keys (ASDF for your
          left hand, and JKL; for your right hand).
        </p>
        <ol className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Placement:</strong> Position your index finger of the left
            hand on the E key and the index finger of the right hand on the I
            key. Your other fingers should naturally fall into place on adjacent
            keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technique:</strong> As you type, remember to use a light
            touch. Press each key firmly but not forcefully, allowing your
            fingers to glide effortlessly across the keyboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice:</strong> Typing is a skill that improves with
            practice. Start with simple exercises, gradually increasing your
            speed and accuracy over time. Patience and persistence are key!
