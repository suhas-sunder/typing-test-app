          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let's begin with the basics. The keyboard, as you see before you, is
          not just a random assortment of keys but a meticulously arranged tool
          designed for efficient communication. Each key serves a specific
          purpose, and understanding their layout is crucial to mastering
          typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at the top row of keys: Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, and P.
          These keys form the foundation of touch typing and are often referred
          to as the "home row" for your fingers.
        </p>

          <li>
            <strong>QWERTY Layout:</strong> Ever wondered why the keys are
            arranged in this seemingly random order? The QWERTY layout, as it's
            known, was designed to prevent typewriter jams by placing commonly
            used letters apart from each other. While its origins date back to
            typewriter days, this layout remains standard on modern keyboards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Top Row Exploration:</strong> Each key on the top row
            corresponds to a letter in the English alphabet. As you become
            familiar with them, you'll notice patterns and develop muscle
            memory, making typing a fluid and effortless task.
          </li>

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the keyboard, it's time to
          dive into the practical aspect of typing. Sit comfortably in front of
          your keyboard, ensuring your posture is upright and your hands rest
          lightly on the home row keys.
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Assign each finger of your
            dominant hand to a specific set of keys. For instance, your index
            finger rests on "F" and "J," your middle finger on "D" and "K," and
            so forth. This technique optimizes speed and accuracy while
            minimizing strain on your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Like any skill,
            typing requires practice to master. Start with simple exercises and
            gradually increase the complexity as you gain proficiency. Don't be
            discouraged by mistakes; they're an integral part of the learning
            process.
