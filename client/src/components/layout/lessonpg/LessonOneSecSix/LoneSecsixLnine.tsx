        <p>
          To type proficiently, it's essential to use the correct finger
          placement. Each finger is assigned to specific keys to facilitate
          smooth and efficient typing. For the top row, here's the recommended
          finger placement:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Left Hand:</strong> Use your left index finger for keys Q,
            W, and E. Your left middle finger should cover R, T, and Y. Your
            left ring finger is for U, and your left pinky finger should rest on
            the P key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Hand:</strong> Mirror the same pattern with your right
            hand. Your right index finger covers keys U, I, and O, your right
            middle finger is for P, L, and K, and so on.
