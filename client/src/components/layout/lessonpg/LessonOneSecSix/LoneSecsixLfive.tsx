          Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The keyboard is divided into several rows, with each
          row serving a specific purpose. The top row, often referred to as the
          "qwerty" row, contains the following keys:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>w</li>
          <li>e</li>
          <li>r</li>
          <li>u</li>
          <li>i</li>
          <li>o</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Getting Started:</h3>
        <p>
          To begin typing, position your fingers on the home row keys. The home
          row is the central row on the keyboard and includes the keys:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>a</li>
          <li>s</li>
          <li>d</li>
          <li>f</li>
          <li>j</li>
          <li>k</li>
          <li>l</li>
          <li>;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Place your left index finger on the "f" key and your right index
          finger on the "j" key. This position serves as your starting point and
          allows you to reach the other keys with ease.

        <p>
          Now, let's practice typing the letters on the top row. Start by
          placing your left index finger on the "r" key and your right index
          finger on the "u" key. Press down gently on each key, making sure to
          use the correct finger for each letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat this process for each letter on the top row, moving from left
          to right. Remember to maintain a steady pace and focus on accuracy
          rather than speed.
