          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
          The keyboard is an essential tool for typing. It consists of several
          rows of keys, each serving a different purpose. Today, we'll focus on
          the bottom row of the keyboard, specifically the keys for your left
          hand: "z" and "v".

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Home Row Position</h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into the specifics, let's talk about the home row. The
          home row is the central row of the keyboard where your fingers should
          rest when not typing. For your left hand, your fingers should be
          placed on the following keys:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            Pinky finger on <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">A</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ring finger on <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">S</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Middle finger on <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">D</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Index finger on <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">F</kbd>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">Your thumbs rest on the spacebar.</p>
