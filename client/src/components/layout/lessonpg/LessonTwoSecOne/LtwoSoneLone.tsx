          Starting with the Basics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we start, let’s get familiar with the keyboard. The keyboard is
          divided into different rows and sections. For now, we will focus on
          the bottom row keys "z" and "x".

        </h4>
        <ol className="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row:</strong> This is where your fingers rest. Your
            left hand fingers rest on the keys:{" "}
            <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">a</kbd>,{" "}
            <kbd className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">s</kbd>,{" "}

        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Typing "z" and "x"</h4>
        <p>
          To type proficiently, it's essential to use the correct finger
          placement. Each finger is assigned to specific keys to facilitate
          smooth and efficient typing. For the bottom row, here's the
          recommended finger placement:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>"z" Key:</strong> Place your left pinky finger on the "a"
            key (home row position). Move your pinky down to press the "z" key.
            Practice this movement several times until it feels natural.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"x" Key:</strong> Place your left ring finger on the "s" key
            (home row position). Move your ring finger down to press the "x"
            key. Again, practice this movement until it becomes easy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Practice Exercise</h4>
        <p>Let’s do some simple exercises to practice these keys:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            Type: <code className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">zxzxzxzx</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Type: <code className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">xz</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Type: <code className="rounded bg-gray-200 p-1">zzxx</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Repeat these exercises several times, ensuring you return your fingers
          to the home row after each keystroke.
