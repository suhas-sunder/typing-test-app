        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we start, let’s get familiar with the keyboard. The keyboard is
          divided into different rows and sections. For now, we will focus on
          the bottom row keys "z" and "x".

          <li>
            <strong>Home Row:</strong> This is where your fingers rest. Your

            <strong>"z" Key:</strong> Place your left pinky finger on the "a"
            key (home row position). Move your pinky down to press the "z" key.
            Practice this movement several times until it feels natural.
