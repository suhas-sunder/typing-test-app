          <li>Sit up straight with your feet flat on the ground.</li>
          <li>
            Your wrists should hover above the keyboard without touching it.

          <li>
            Place your fingers on the "home row" keys:{" "}

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">Z Key</h4>
        <p className="pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Your left pinky finger is responsible for pressing the Z key. Keep
          your pinky finger on the A key and gently move it down to press the Z
          key when needed.

        <p className="pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The X key is pressed with your left ring finger. Normally, your left
          ring finger rests on the S key. Move it down to the X key when typing.

          English Literacy Tips
        </h3>
        <p className="pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's incorporate some English literacy practice while learning these
          keys. We will use simple words that involve the Z, X, and C keys:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Zoo:</strong> This word uses the Z key. A zoo is a place
            where animals are kept for public display. It's a great way to
            remember the Z key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mix:</strong> This word includes the X key. To mix means to
            combine different substances together. A fun way to practice the X
            key!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cat:</strong> Although it doesn't use the Z, X, or C keys
            directly, knowing that C is used for words like "cat" helps with
            familiarization.

          Examples and Analogies
        </h3>
        <p className="pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Think of learning to type as learning to ride a bicycle. At first, it
          may seem challenging, and you might feel clumsy. But with regular
          practice, your fingers will become like the pedals of a bicycle –
          moving smoothly and efficiently without much conscious effort. Each
          key you press accurately is like a pedal stroke propelling you
          forward.

          Importance of Habitual Practice
        </h3>
        <p className="pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Like any other skill, habitual practice is key to mastering typing.
          Set aside time each day to practice, starting with simple exercises
          and gradually increasing complexity. Consistency is crucial – even
          just 10-15 minutes a day can lead to significant improvement over
          time. As you practice typing, you'll also enhance your English
          literacy, becoming more familiar with word patterns and sentence
          structures.

          Happy typing! With dedication and practice, you'll soon find yourself
          typing with ease and confidence. Remember, every expert was once a
          beginner. Keep practicing, stay positive, and enjoy the journey of
          learning.
