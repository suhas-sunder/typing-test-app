          The Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The standard keyboard layout is known as the QWERTY layout, named
          after the first six letters on the top row of letters. It's designed
          to make typing efficient and comfortable. The keyboard is divided into
          several rows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Top Row</strong>: QWERTYUIOP
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row</strong>: ASDFGHJKL
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bottom Row</strong>: ZXCVBNM
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Today, we'll focus on the bottom row, specifically the keys for your
          left hand: <strong>X, C, and V</strong>.

          Getting Started with Typing
        </h3>
        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          Posture and Hand Position
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before you begin typing, ensure you are seated comfortably. Your back
          should be straight, your feet flat on the ground, and your wrists
          should be level with the keyboard. Proper posture helps prevent strain
          and increases typing efficiency.
        </p>
        <ol className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row Position:</strong> Place your fingers on the home
            row keys. Your left hand should be on A, S, D, and F, and your right
            hand on J, K, L, and ;. Your thumbs should rest lightly on the space
            bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reaching for Bottom Row Keys:</strong> To type X, C, or V,
            move only your left index, middle, and ring fingers down from the
            home row keys F, D, and S respectively.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          Typing X, C, and V

        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Practice pressing each key individually and then in combination with
          other letters. Start slowly to ensure accuracy before increasing your
          speed.
