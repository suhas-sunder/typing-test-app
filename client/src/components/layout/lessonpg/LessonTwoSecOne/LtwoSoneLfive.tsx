          process of inputting text into a device, such as a computer, using a

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">The Keyboard Layout</h3>
        <p>
          The standard keyboard layout is known as the QWERTY layout, named
          after the first six letters on the top row of letters. It's designed
          to make typing efficient and comfortable. The keyboard is divided into
          several rows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Top Row</strong>: QWERTYUIOP
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row</strong>: ASDFGHJKL
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bottom Row</strong>: ZXCVBNM
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Today, we'll focus on the bottom row, specifically the keys for your
          left hand: <strong>X, C, and V</strong>.

          Getting Started with Typing
        </h3>
        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
          Posture and Hand Position
        </h4>
        <p>
          Before you begin typing, ensure you are seated comfortably. Your back
          should be straight, your feet flat on the ground, and your wrists
          should be level with the keyboard. Proper posture helps prevent strain
          and increases typing efficiency.
        </p>
        <ol className="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Row Position:</strong> Place your fingers on the home
            row keys. Your left hand should be on A, S, D, and F, and your right
            hand on J, K, L, and ;. Your thumbs should rest lightly on the space
            bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reaching for Bottom Row Keys:</strong> To type X, C, or V,
            move only your left index, middle, and ring fingers down from the
            home row keys F, D, and S respectively.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Typing X, C, and V</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>X</strong>: Move your left ring finger from S to X.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>C</strong>: Move your left middle finger from D to C.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>V</strong>: Move your left index finger from F to V.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Practice pressing each key individually and then in combination with
          other letters. Start slowly to ensure accuracy before increasing your
          speed.
