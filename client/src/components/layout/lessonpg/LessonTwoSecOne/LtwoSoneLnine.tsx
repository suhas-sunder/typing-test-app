          Understanding the Layout:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before diving into typing exercises, it's essential to understand the
          layout of the keyboard. The bottom row, also known as the home row, is
          where your fingers naturally rest. Your left-hand fingers should be
          positioned as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Pinky finger (little finger):</strong> Rests on the "Z" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ring finger:</strong> Positioned over the "X" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Middle finger:</strong> Hovers above the "C" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Index finger:</strong> Ready to strike the "V" key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thumb:</strong> Positioned near the space bar, ready for
            support.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Developing Muscle Memory:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Typing is all about muscle memory. Repetition is key to training your
          fingers to find the correct keys effortlessly. Start by placing your
          left-hand fingers on the designated keys (ZXCVB). Then, practice
          striking each key individually, focusing on accuracy and smooth
          movements.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Imagine your fingers as skilled dancers, gracefully gliding across the
          keyboard with precision and grace. With practice, you'll find that
          your fingers instinctively know where to go without conscious effort.

          Typing Exercises:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's put theory into practice with some typing exercises. Begin
          by typing simple words that utilize the keys on the bottom row. Start
          with words like "box," "vex," "cab," and "buzz." As you become more
          comfortable, challenge yourself with longer words and sentences.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Think of typing exercises as mental workouts for your fingers. Each
          keystroke strengthens your muscle memory, gradually increasing your
          typing speed and accuracy.
