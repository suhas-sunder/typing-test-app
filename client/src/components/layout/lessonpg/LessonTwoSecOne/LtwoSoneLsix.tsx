      </h2>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <p className="mb-4">
          Welcome, eager learner, to the wonderful world of typing! Today, we
          embark on an exciting journey to equip you with the fundamental skills
          needed to navigate the keyboard with confidence. If you've never
          touched a keyboard before, fear not! We'll start from scratch and work
          our way up, step by step.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">Getting Started:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's begin by familiarizing ourselves with the left-hand side of the
          bottom row of the keyboard. This row consists of three keys: Z, X, and
          C. Each key plays a unique role in facilitating your typing journey.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Z:</strong> Positioned at the far left, the letter "Z" may
            seem insignificant, but it holds great importance. It serves as the
            starting point for your left-hand journey across the keyboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>X:</strong> Located in the middle, "X" follows "Z" and
            precedes "C." It's the bridge between the two neighboring keys,
            requiring a slight movement of your left index finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>C:</strong> The final destination on the left-hand side of
            the bottom row, "C" completes the trio. Your left ring finger
            reaches out to strike this key, bringing closure to the sequence.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">Proper Technique:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the keys, let's delve into
          proper typing technique. Sit up straight, with your feet flat on the
          floor and wrists relaxed. Position your fingers over the designated
          keys, with your left index finger on "F," left middle finger on "D,"
          left ring finger on "S," and left little finger on "A."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As you approach the bottom row, maintain a light touch and use the
          appropriate fingers for each key. For the bottom row left-hand keys—Z,
          X, and C—your left little finger, left ring finger, and left middle
          finger should be employed, respectively.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, it's time for hands-on practice! Begin by placing your left hand
          in the starting position, with your left little finger resting on "Z."
          Gradually progress through the sequence, moving from "Z" to "X" and
          finally to "C." Pay attention to your finger movements, striving for
          fluidity and accuracy.
