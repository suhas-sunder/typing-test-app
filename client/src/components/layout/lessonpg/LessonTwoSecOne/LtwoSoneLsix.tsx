          Understanding the Keyboard
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Let's begin by acquainting ourselves with the keyboard. Picture it as
          a canvas, where each key is a stroke of paint, contributing to the
          masterpiece of your typed document. The bottom row, where "cvb"
          resides, is akin to the foundation of a building – sturdy and
          essential.

          Positioning Your Hands
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Imagine your hands as dancers gracefully gliding across the keys. For
          the left hand, position your index finger on "c," middle finger on
          "v," and ring finger on "b." This ergonomic arrangement ensures
          efficiency and comfort as you navigate the keyboard landscape.

          Starting with the Left Hand: cvb
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>C:</strong> The index finger elegantly taps "c," reminiscent
          of a conductor initiating a symphony. Press gently yet firmly,
          allowing the key to respond to your command.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>V:</strong> Transition seamlessly to "v" with your middle
          finger. Picture it as a bridge connecting ideas – in this case,
          letters – fluidly transferring from one to the next.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <strong>B:</strong> Conclude the sequence with "b," courtesy of your
          ring finger. Think of it as the final brushstroke, completing the
          canvas of characters with finesse.
