        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          keyboard layout. The keyboard is divided into several rows, each
          containing different groups of letters, numbers, and symbols. The

          the letters z, x, c, v, and b.

          Typing Technique:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's talk about the actual typing technique. When typing the
          letters on the bottom row with your left hand, use the corresponding
          finger for each key. For example, use your left pinky to press "z,"
          your left ring finger to press "x," and so on. Remember to keep your
          fingers close to the home row position after typing each letter to
          maintain accuracy and speed.
