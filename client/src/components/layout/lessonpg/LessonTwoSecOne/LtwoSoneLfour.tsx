          The Basics of Typing
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Typing is the act of inputting text by pressing keys on a keyboard.
          It’s an essential skill in today’s digital world, much like writing
          was with pen and paper. Mastering typing can greatly benefit you in
          both personal and professional aspects of life. From writing emails
          and essays to coding and data entry, typing is a fundamental skill
          that will make your work more efficient and your communication
          clearer.

          The Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The keyboard might look overwhelming at first, but it's just like any
          other tool—you'll get more comfortable with practice. Keyboards are
          typically laid out in a QWERTY format, named after the first six
          letters on the top row of letters.

          Understanding Home Row Position
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          The "home row" is the middle row of letters where your fingers will
          rest. For the left hand, your fingers will rest on the keys: A, S, D,
          and F. For the right hand, they will rest on J, K, L, and ;. From this
          position, you can reach all other keys. Each finger is responsible for
          a specific group of keys.

          Bottom Row Left Hand: Focusing on Z and B
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Today, we will focus on the bottom row keys for the left hand,
          specifically the letters "Z" and "B".
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          Z Key:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Your left pinky (little finger) is responsible for reaching the "Z"
          key. While resting on the "A" key, you move your pinky down to hit
          "Z".
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold leading-loose">
          B Key:
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Your left index finger is responsible for the "B" key. While resting
          on the "F" key, you move your index finger down to hit "B".
        </p>

        <div className="mb-4 mt-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <p>
            <strong>Practice these movements:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol className="mb-2 mt-2 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 pl-6 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
            <li>
              <strong>Rest Position:</strong> Place your fingers on the home
              row. Your left pinky should be on "A", your ring finger on "S",
              your middle finger on "D", and your index finger on "F".
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Z Key Movement:</strong> From the home row, move your left
              pinky straight down to press the "Z" key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>B Key Movement:</strong> From the home row, move your left
              index finger down and slightly to the right to press the "B" key.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4 mt-2 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
            Practice these movements slowly at first. Accuracy is more important
            than speed when you're starting out.

          Importance of Learning Typing
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Typing is not just about speed; it also improves your accuracy and

          <li>
            <strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Whether you're writing an
            essay, coding, or chatting online, typing faster allows you to get
            your thoughts out more quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better Focus:</strong> When you can type without looking at
            the keyboard, you can focus more on what you're writing, leading to
            clearer and more coherent thoughts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Edge:</strong> Many jobs require computer
            skills, and typing is a fundamental part of that. Proficiency in
            typing can set you apart in the job market.

          The Importance of Practice
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Practice is crucial in mastering typing. Like learning to ride a bike,
          the more you practice, the more comfortable and natural it becomes.
          Regular practice will help you improve both your typing speed and
          accuracy. Additionally, as you become more proficient, your English
          literacy will also improve. You'll find it easier to write essays,
          reports, and communicate more effectively.

          Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Don't get discouraged by
          initial difficulties. With consistent practice and a positive
          attitude, you'll soon find typing to be second nature. Embrace the
          journey, celebrate your progress, and keep pushing forward.
