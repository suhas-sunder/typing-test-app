        Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Before diving into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard
        layout. The bottom row, also known as the home row, consists of the
        letters z, x, c, n, and m. These keys serve as the foundation for typing
        and are positioned beneath your fingers' resting position.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Getting Started:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        To begin typing, place your fingers on the home row, with your left
        pinky finger resting on the letter 'a' and your right pinky finger on
        the semicolon ';' key. From there, extend your fingers to reach the keys
        of the bottom row.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Learning the Fingers' Movements:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Each finger is assigned specific keys to press within the bottom row:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Left Ring Finger (s):</strong> Presses the 'x' key.

        <li>

        Practice Makes Perfect:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Now that you understand the finger placements, it's time to practice!
        Start by typing each letter of the bottom row slowly and deliberately,
        focusing on accuracy rather than speed. As you become more comfortable,
        gradually increase your typing speed while maintaining precision.
