        Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard
        layout. The bottom row, also known as the home row, consists of the
        letters z, x, c, n, and m. These keys serve as the foundation for typing
        and are positioned beneath your fingers' resting position.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Getting Started:</h3>
      <p>
        To begin typing, place your fingers on the home row, with your left
        pinky finger resting on the letter 'a' and your right pinky finger on
        the semicolon ';' key. From there, extend your fingers to reach the keys
        of the bottom row.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">
        Learning the Fingers' Movements:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each finger is assigned specific keys to press within the bottom row:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          <strong>Left Pinky (a):</strong> Presses the 'z' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Left Ring Finger (s):</strong> Presses the 'x' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Left Middle Finger (d):</strong> Presses the 'c' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Left Index Finger (f):</strong> Presses the 'v' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right Index Finger (j):</strong> Presses the 'm' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right Middle Finger (k):</strong> Presses the 'n' key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right Ring Finger (l):</strong> Presses the ',' (comma) key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right Pinky Finger (;):</strong> Presses the '.' (period) key.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Practice Makes Perfect:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you understand the finger placements, it's time to practice!
        Start by typing each letter of the bottom row slowly and deliberately,
        focusing on accuracy rather than speed. As you become more comfortable,
        gradually increase your typing speed while maintaining precision.
