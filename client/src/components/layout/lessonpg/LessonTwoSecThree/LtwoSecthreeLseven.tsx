        Understanding the Keyboard:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is like a magical portal to a
        world of possibilities. Each key represents a letter, number, or symbol,
        and together they form the building blocks of communication.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Meet the Bottom Row:</h3>
      <p>
        Today, our focus is on the bottom row of the keyboard, specifically the
        keys 'cvbnm,.' These keys are like the foundation of a sturdy house.
        They may seem humble, but they play a crucial role in your typing
        journey.

      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">
        Learning to Position Your Fingers:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Imagine your fingers as dancers gracefully gliding across the keyboard.
        Place your left pinky finger on the 'c' key, your left ring finger on
        the 'v' key, your left middle finger on the 'b' key, and your left index
        finger on the 'n' key. Similarly, position your right hand, starting
        with your right index finger on the 'm' key and ending with your right
        pinky finger on the ',' (comma) key.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Technique:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that your fingers are in position, gently press down on the keys
        using the pads of your fingertips. Avoid using excessive force, as it
        can lead to fatigue and decrease typing speed. Remember, it's all about
        finesse!
      </p>

        Understanding English Language Literacy:
      </h3>
      <p>

        English. As you improve your typing skills, you'll also enhance your
        grasp of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. It's like

        <li>Which finger should you use to press the 'c' key?</li>

        The Importance of Practice:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Remember, mastering typing is a journey, not a destination. Dedicate
        time each day to practice, and you'll gradually improve both your typing
        accuracy and speed. As you become more proficient, you'll also notice an
        increase in your overall literacy skills, including English language
