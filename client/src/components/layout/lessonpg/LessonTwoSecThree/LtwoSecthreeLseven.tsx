        Understanding the Keyboard:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Let's start with the basics. The keyboard is like a magical portal to a
        world of possibilities. Each key represents a letter, number, or symbol,
        and together they form the building blocks of communication.

        Meet the Bottom Row:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Today, our focus is on the bottom row of the keyboard, specifically the
        keys 'cvbnm,.' These keys are like the foundation of a sturdy house.
        They may seem humble, but they play a crucial role in your typing
        journey.

        Learning to Position Your Fingers:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Imagine your fingers as dancers gracefully gliding across the keyboard.
        Place your left pinky finger on the 'c' key, your left ring finger on
        the 'v' key, your left middle finger on the 'b' key, and your left index
        finger on the 'n' key. Similarly, position your right hand, starting
        with your right index finger on the 'm' key and ending with your right
        pinky finger on the ',' (comma) key.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        The Technique:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Now that your fingers are in position, gently press down on the keys
        using the pads of your fingertips. Avoid using excessive force, as it
        can lead to fatigue and decrease typing speed. Remember, it's all about
        finesse!
