          Understanding the Keyboard Layout
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the
          layout of the standard QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard consists of rows
          of keys, each serving a specific purpose. The bottom row, also known
          as the home row, includes the keys ZXCVBNM. These keys are typically
          pressed by the fingers of your left and right hands' little fingers
          and thumbs.

          <li>
            <strong>Z and X:</strong> These keys are located on the left side of
            the bottom row. They are commonly used in various shortcuts and
            commands in software applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>N and M:</strong> Found on the right side of the bottom row,
            these keys are frequently used in typing words, especially those
            with letters 'N' and 'M', such as 'name' or 'mango'.

          Basic Typing Techniques

        <ol className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Position your left little finger
            on the 'Z' key and your right little finger on the 'M' key. Your
            thumbs should rest on the space bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Touch Typing:</strong> Aim to type without looking at the
            keyboard. Trusting your muscle memory will significantly increase
            your typing speed and accuracy over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hand Movement:</strong> Minimize excessive hand movement by
            keeping your fingers close to the home row. This will help you type
            faster and reduce strain on your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Like any skill, typing improves
            with practice. Set aside time each day to practice typing exercises
            and gradually increase the difficulty as you become more proficient.
