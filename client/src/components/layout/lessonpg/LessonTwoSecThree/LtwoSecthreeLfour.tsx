        Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the layout
        of a standard keyboard. The keyboard is divided into several rows, each
        serving a specific purpose. Today, we'll focus on the bottom row, which
        consists of the keys "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", and "m".
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Imagine the keyboard as a landscape, with each row representing a
        different terrain. The bottom row, much like the foundation of a
        building, provides stability and support for the rest of the keys above
        it.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Getting Started:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the bottom row, let's begin
        typing! Place your fingers on the home row, where your left index finger
        rests on the "f" key and your right index finger rests on the "j" key.
        Your other fingers should naturally fall onto the keys adjacent to the
        home row.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        The Technique:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        To type the letters on the bottom row, use your corresponding fingers.
        For example, use your left index finger to press the "z" key, your left
        middle finger for the "x" key, and so on. Remember to maintain a relaxed
        posture and keep your wrists straight to avoid strain.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Practice Makes Perfect:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Start with simple
        exercises focusing on the bottom row letters. Gradually increase the
        complexity as you become more comfortable. Don't worry about speed at
        first; focus on accuracy and building muscle memory.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">

        and in your professional endeavors. From composing emails and reports to
