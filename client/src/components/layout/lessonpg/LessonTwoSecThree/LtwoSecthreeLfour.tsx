        professional, or just someone looking to improve your skills, learning
        how to type proficiently is an invaluable asset in today's digital age.

        Understanding the Keyboard Layout:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before we dive into typing, let's familiarize ourselves with the layout
        of a standard keyboard. The keyboard is divided into several rows, each
        serving a specific purpose. Today, we'll focus on the bottom row, which
        consists of the keys "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", and "m".
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the keyboard as a landscape, with each row representing a
        different terrain. The bottom row, much like the foundation of a
        building, provides stability and support for the rest of the keys above
        it.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Getting Started:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the bottom row, let's begin
        typing! Place your fingers on the home row, where your left index finger
        rests on the "f" key and your right index finger rests on the "j" key.
        Your other fingers should naturally fall onto the keys adjacent to the
        home row.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Technique:</h3>
      <p>
        To type the letters on the bottom row, use your corresponding fingers.
        For example, use your left index finger to press the "z" key, your left
        middle finger for the "x" key, and so on. Remember to maintain a relaxed
        posture and keep your wrists straight to avoid strain.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Practice Makes Perfect:</h3>
      <p>
        Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Start with simple
        exercises focusing on the bottom row letters. Gradually increase the
        complexity as you become more comfortable. Don't worry about speed at
        first; focus on accuracy and building muscle memory.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">

        English Language Literacy:
      </h3>

        correlation between typing proficiency and English language literacy.
