        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Basics of Typing:</h3>
        <p>
          Before we dive into the specifics of the bottom row, let's start with
          the fundamentals. The keyboard layout we commonly use is called the
          QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters in the top row. Each
          key on the keyboard corresponds to a specific letter, number, symbol,
          or function.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The bottom row of the keyboard, also known as the home row for your
          fingers, consists of the following keys:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>Z - Located at the leftmost end of the bottom row.</li>
          <li>X - Next to the Z key.</li>
          <li>C - Positioned between the X and V keys.</li>
          <li>V - Follows the C key.</li>
          <li>B - Adjacent to the V key.</li>
          <li>N - Located next to the B key.</li>
          <li>M - Positioned beside the N key.</li>
          <li>
            ,/. - Comprising the remaining keys, with the comma (,) and period

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Getting Started:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Positioning:</strong> Sit comfortably in front of your
          keyboard with your back straight and your wrists hovering slightly
          above the keyboard. Your fingers should rest lightly on the home row
          keys: ASDF for the left hand and JKL; for the right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Assign each finger to a specific
          key on the bottom row. Your left hand should cover Z, X, C, V, and B
          keys, while your right hand should cover N, M, comma, and period keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Practice:</strong> Start by typing each key on the bottom row
          slowly and deliberately. Pay attention to the placement of your
          fingers and the movement of your hands across the keyboard.
