        Mastering Typing: A Beginner's Guide to the Bottom Row - zvn
      </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome, dear student, to the world of typing! Today, we embark on a
        journey to master the bottom row of the keyboard, specifically the keys
        z, v, and n. For someone who is just starting, let's begin with the
        basics.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">
        Understanding the Keyboard:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before we delve into the specifics of the bottom row, it's crucial to
        understand the layout of the keyboard. The keyboard is divided into
        several rows, with each row serving a specific purpose. The bottom row,
        where the keys z, v, and n reside, is particularly important for
        efficient typing.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Positioning Your Hands:</h3>
      <p>
        Place your fingers on the home row, which is the middle row of keys on
        the keyboard. Your left index finger should rest on the "f" key, and
        your right index finger should rest on the "j" key. This positioning
        allows for easy access to the keys on the bottom row.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">
        Introducing the Bottom Row:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          <strong>z:</strong> This key is located on the left side of the bottom
          row. Use your left pinky finger to reach for it without moving your
          other fingers from the home row.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>v:</strong> Positioned in the middle of the bottom row, the
          "v" key is easily accessible by your left index finger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>n:</strong> Situated on the right side of the bottom row, the
          "n" key is within reach of your right index finger.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Practice Makes Perfect:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you're acquainted with the bottom row keys, it's time to
        practice. Start with simple exercises to familiarize yourself with the
        placement of these keys. As you gain confidence, gradually increase the
        difficulty of the exercises.
