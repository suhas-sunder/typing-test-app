      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Welcome, dear student, to the world of typing! Today, we embark on a
        journey to master the bottom row of the keyboard, specifically the keys
        z, v, and n. For someone who is just starting, let's begin with the
        basics.

        Understanding the Keyboard:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Before we delve into the specifics of the bottom row, it's crucial to
        understand the layout of the keyboard. The keyboard is divided into
        several rows, with each row serving a specific purpose. The bottom row,
        where the keys z, v, and n reside, is particularly important for
        efficient typing.

        Positioning Your Hands:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Place your fingers on the home row, which is the middle row of keys on
        the keyboard. Your left index finger should rest on the "f" key, and
        your right index finger should rest on the "j" key. This positioning
        allows for easy access to the keys on the bottom row.
      </p>

        Introducing the Bottom Row:
      </h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        <li>
          <strong>z:</strong> This key is located on the left side of the bottom
          row. Use your left pinky finger to reach for it without moving your
          other fingers from the home row.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>v:</strong> Positioned in the middle of the bottom row, the
          "v" key is easily accessible by your left index finger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>n:</strong> Situated on the right side of the bottom row, the
          "n" key is within reach of your right index finger.
        </li>
      </ul>

        placement of these keys. As you gain confidence, gradually increase the
        difficulty of the exercises.
