        Finger Positioning:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Let's start with the basics. First, ensure that your fingers are
        correctly positioned on the keyboard. Place your left pinky finger on
        the 'A' key, your ring finger on the 'S' key, your middle finger on the
        'D' key, and your index finger on the 'F' key. On the right side, place
        your index finger on the 'J' key, your middle finger on the 'K' key,
        your ring finger on the 'L' key, and your pinky finger on the ';' key.
        This is known as the home row position.

        Bottom Row Keys:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Now, let's focus on the bottom row of the keyboard: ZXCVBNM. These keys
        are crucial for typing efficiently. Each finger should be responsible
        for specific keys. Your left pinky finger is responsible for the 'Z'
        key, your ring finger for the 'X' key, your middle finger for the 'C'
        key, and your index finger for the 'V' key. On the right side, your
        index finger is responsible for the 'M' key, your middle finger for the
        ',' key, your ring finger for the '.' key, and your pinky finger for the
        '/' key.
