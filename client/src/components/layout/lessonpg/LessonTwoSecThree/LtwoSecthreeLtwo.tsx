        Understanding the Keyboard Layout
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Let's start from the basics. The keyboard is divided into rows, each
        with its own set of keys. The bottom row, often referred to as the "home
        row," is where your fingers naturally rest when you're not typing. On
        this row, you'll find the keys{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">z, c, and n</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Positioning Your Fingers
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers gracefully gliding across the
        keyboard. Place your left index finger on the{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">"z"</strong> key, your left middle
        finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "x"</strong> key, and your left
        ring finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "c"</strong> key. Similarly,
        position your right index finger on the{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">"n"</strong> key, your right middle
        finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "m"</strong> key, and your right
        ring finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> ","</strong> (comma) key.

        Typing Technique
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        With your fingers in position, gently press down on the keys using the
        pads of your fingertips. Avoid using excessive force, as it can lead to
        fatigue and decrease typing speed. Focus on maintaining a relaxed
        posture and keeping your wrists straight to prevent strain.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold leading-loose">
        Practice Makes Perfect
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
        Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Start with simple
        exercises to familiarize yourself with the keys. As you gain confidence,
        gradually increase the difficulty by typing longer passages or
        challenging yourself with speed tests.
