        Welcome to the fascinating world of typing!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Today, we embark on a journey to unlock the potential of your keyboard.
        Whether you're typing a school assignment, composing an email, or
        chatting with friends, mastering typing is an essential skill that will
        serve you well in both your personal and professional life.

        Understanding the Keyboard Layout
      </h3>
      <p>
        Let's start from the basics. The keyboard is divided into rows, each
        with its own set of keys. The bottom row, often referred to as the "home
        row," is where your fingers naturally rest when you're not typing. On
        this row, you'll find the keys{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">z, c, and n</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Positioning Your Fingers</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine your fingers as nimble dancers gracefully gliding across the
        keyboard. Place your left index finger on the{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">"z"</strong> key, your left middle
        finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "x"</strong> key, and your left
        ring finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "c"</strong> key. Similarly,
        position your right index finger on the{" "}
        <strong className="text-purple-600">"n"</strong> key, your right middle
        finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> "m"</strong> key, and your right
        ring finger on the
        <strong className="text-purple-600"> ","</strong> (comma) key.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Typing Technique</h3>
      <p>
        With your fingers in position, gently press down on the keys using the
        pads of your fingertips. Avoid using excessive force, as it can lead to
        fatigue and decrease typing speed. Focus on maintaining a relaxed
        posture and keeping your wrists straight to prevent strain.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
      <p>
        Like any skill, typing requires practice to master. Start with simple
        exercises to familiarize yourself with the keys. As you gain confidence,
        gradually increase the difficulty by typing longer passages or
        challenging yourself with speed tests.
