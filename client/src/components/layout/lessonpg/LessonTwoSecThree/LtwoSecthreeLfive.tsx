      <p>

        Understanding the Keyboard:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before delving into the specifics of typing, let's familiarize ourselves
        with the keyboard layout. The bottom row, also known as the home row, is
        where your fingers naturally rest when not typing. It consists of the
        following keys:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          <strong>x:</strong> Situated on the far left of the bottom row, this
          key is commonly used in various words and commands.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c:</strong> Adjacent to 'x,' 'c' is another frequently used
          key in the English language. It plays a vital role in forming words
          and executing commands.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>v:</strong> Moving towards the center, 'v' stands as a pivotal
          key in typing. Its usage extends to numerous words and functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>m:</strong> Positioned next to 'v,' 'm' marks the end of the
          bottom row. Like its predecessors, 'm' is integral to typing words and
          executing commands.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>,</strong>: Finally, we have the comma, placed to the right of
          'm.' The comma serves to punctuate sentences and is an essential
          component of written communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>.</strong>: Lastly, to the right of the comma, we have the
          period. Much like the comma, the period aids in structuring sentences
          and indicating pauses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Learning the Fingering:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the keys, it's time to learn
        the proper fingering technique. Place your left index finger on 'x,'
        your left middle finger on 'c,' your left ring finger on 'v,' and your
        left pinky on 'm.' Similarly, position your right index finger on '.,'
        your right middle finger on 'm,' your right ring finger on 'v,' and your
        right pinky on 'c.'
