          English Language Literacy:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          English language literacy is the ability to read, write, and
          understand English effectively. As you improve your typing skills,
          you're also enhancing your English language literacy. Typing
          reinforces spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, as you engage with words
          and sentences on the keyboard. So, every time you type, you're not
          just practicing typing; you're also strengthening your language
          skills.
