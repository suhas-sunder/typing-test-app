        <p>
          Before delving into the specific keys, let's ensure we're on the same
          page regarding the basics of typing. The keyboard is like a map, and
          each key is a destination. By mastering the layout, you can navigate

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">The Top Row Right Hand:</h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's focus on the keys <strong>i, o, and p</strong>. These keys
          reside on the top row of the keyboard, right under your fingertips
          when your hands are properly positioned.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>"i"</strong> sits snugly beneath your right index finger.
            It's a frequently used letter in the English language, making it a
            pivotal key to master. Imagine it as the conductor orchestrating the
            symphony of your sentences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"o"</strong> is next in line, positioned just below your
            right middle finger. Think of it as the gateway to roundness—round
            vowels, round worlds, all encapsulated within this humble letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"p"</strong> completes the trio, nestled under your right
            ring finger. It's the anchor, grounding your words and thoughts onto
            the digital canvas.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Practice Makes Perfect:</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you know the lay of the land, it's time to put theory into
          practice. Sit comfortably, ensuring your posture is conducive to
          typing. Rest your fingers gently on the home row—<strong>ASDF</strong>{" "}
          for your left hand and <strong>JKL;</strong> for your right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visualize the keys <strong>i, o, and p</strong> in your mind's eye.
          With deliberate movements, press each key, feeling the rhythm and flow
          of typing. Don't worry about speed at first; focus on accuracy and
          building muscle memory.
