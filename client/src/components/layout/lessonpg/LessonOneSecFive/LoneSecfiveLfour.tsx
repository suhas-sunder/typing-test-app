          Let's Start with the Basics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Imagine the keyboard as a vast landscape, with each key representing a
          unique destination. Our focus today rests on the top row, specifically
          the letters "y" and "p," nestled comfortably under your right hand's
          command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving into the practical exercises, let's ensure we're in the
          proper posture. Sit upright, feet firmly planted on the ground, and
          position your hands delicately over the keyboard. Your fingers should
          hover gracefully, poised to dance across the keys.

        <p>
          Now, let's acquaint ourselves with our protagonists for today: the
          right index finger and right pinky. The "y" key awaits your index
          finger's touch, positioned directly beneath it. Picture this motion as
          plucking a ripe fruit from a tree, smooth and deliberate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we turn our attention to the "p" key, patiently awaiting the
          pinky's embrace. Extend your pinky with grace, like a dancer reaching
          for a partner's hand, and press the key lightly. Feel the rhythm of
          the keyboard beneath your fingertips as you strike each key with
          purpose.

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">Quiz Time!</h3>
        <p>Now, let's put your newfound knowledge to the test with a quiz:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>Which fingers do you use to type "y" and "p" on the keyboard?</li>
          <li>
            Can you think of a word that contains both the letters "y" and "p"?
          </li>
          <li>Describe the proper posture for typing.</li>
          <li>
            How can proficient typing skills benefit you in real life and
            professional settings?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why is habitual practice essential for improving typing accuracy,
            speed, and language literacy?
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Remember, practice is the cornerstone of mastery. Just as a sculptor
          hones their craft through consistent practice, so too does the typist
          refine their skills with dedication and perseverance. Keep typing,
          keep learning, and most importantly, keep smiling. Happy typing!
