          Let's Start with the Basics
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Imagine the keyboard as a vast landscape, with each key representing a
          unique destination. Our focus today rests on the top row, specifically
          the letters "y" and "p," nestled comfortably under your right hand's
          command.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Before diving into the practical exercises, let's ensure we're in the
          proper posture. Sit upright, feet firmly planted on the ground, and
          position your hands delicately over the keyboard. Your fingers should
          hover gracefully, poised to dance across the keys.

          Exploring the Keys
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Now, let's acquaint ourselves with our protagonists for today: the
          right index finger and right pinky. The "y" key awaits your index
          finger's touch, positioned directly beneath it. Picture this motion as
          plucking a ripe fruit from a tree, smooth and deliberate.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-3 font-lato text-lg leading-loose text-slate-700">
          Next, we turn our attention to the "p" key, patiently awaiting the
          pinky's embrace. Extend your pinky with grace, like a dancer reaching
          for a partner's hand, and press the key lightly. Feel the rhythm of
          the keyboard beneath your fingertips as you strike each key with
          purpose.
