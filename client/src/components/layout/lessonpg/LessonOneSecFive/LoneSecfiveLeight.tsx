          Understanding the Basics:
        </h3>
        <p>
          First and foremost, let's familiarize ourselves with the keyboard
          layout. The keyboard is divided into several rows, with each row
          accommodating specific sets of letters and symbols. The top row, known
          as the "qwerty" row, houses the letters "yuiop" on the right-hand
          side.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of the top row right-hand keys:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>y:</strong> The letter "y" is positioned at the far left of
            the top row. Give it a try by gently pressing the key with your
            right index finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>u:</strong> Adjacent to "y" lies the letter "u." Use your
            right index finger to reach out and press this key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>i:</strong> Following "u" is the letter "i." Employ your
            right index finger to strike this key effortlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>o:</strong> The next key is "o," situated beside "i." Engage
            your right index finger once more to tap this letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>p:</strong> Finally, we have the letter "p" at the far right
            end of the top row. Extend your right index finger to press this key
            with finesse.
          </li>
        </ul>
