The leader leads, and the boss drives." Quote #64 By Nelson Mandela: "It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership." Quote #65 By Ronald Reagan: "The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things." Quote #66 By Richard Nixon: "The greatest leader needs the smallest ego." Quote #67 By Oprah Winfrey: "The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." Quote #68 By Angela Duckworth: "Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality." Quote #69 By Albert Einstein: "Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value." Quote #70 By Colin Powell: "Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership." Quote #71 By Jeff Bezos: "The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?' That’s a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?'" Quote #72 By Malcolm X: "Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." Quote #73 By J.K. Rowling: "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default." Quote #74 By Dalai Lama: "Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them." Quote #75 By Benjamin Franklin: "Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn." Quote #76 By Bill Clinton: "The price of doing the same old thing is far higher than the price of change." Quote #77 By Stephen Covey: "Strength lies in differences, not in similarities." Quote #78 By Aung San Suu Kyi: "The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear." Quote #79 By Walt Disney: "All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them." Quote #80 By Thomas Jefferson: "I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it." Quote #81 By Martin Luther King Jr.: "The time is always right to do what is right." Quote #82 By Warren Buffett: "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently." Quote #83 By Helen Keller: "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." Quote #84 By Sheryl Sandberg: "Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence." Quote #85 By Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do." Quote #86 By Vince Lombardi: "Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence." Quote #87 By Angela Merkel: "Sometimes you have to be willing to deal with short-term pain to enjoy long-term gain." Quote #88 By Margaret Thatcher: "Don't follow the crowd, let the crowd follow you." Quote #89 By Mark Zuckerberg: "The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks." Quote #90 By Oprah Winfrey: "The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." Quote #91 By George Washington: "It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one." Quote #92 By Henry Ford: "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right." Quote #93 By Anne Mulcahy: "Employees are a company's greatest asset - they're your competitive advantage." Quote #94 By Michael Jordan: "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." Quote #95 By Colin Powell: "Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership." Quote #96 By John Quincy Adams: "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader." Quote #97 By Elon Musk: "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." Quote #98 By Maya Angelou: "I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." Quote #99 By Ralph Nader: "The function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers." Quote #100 By Vince Lombardi: "The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor."`,
